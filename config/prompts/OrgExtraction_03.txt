{
  "classified_organizations": [
    {
      "organization_name": "World Health Organization",
      "organization_type": "IO",
      "reasoning": "WHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations with 194 member states - clearly an intergovernmental international organization",
      "confidence": "high",
      "supporting_quotes": [
        "elected Director-General of the World Health Organization"
      ]
    },

      "organization_name": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs",
      "organization_type": "NatGov",
      "reasoning": "Ministry is a national government department responsible for foreign policy",
      "confidence": "high",
      "supporting_quotes": [
        "served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1995 to 2000"
      ]
    },
    {
      "organization_name": "Stanford University",
      "organization_type": "other",
      "reasoning": "University - academic institution that doesn't fit IO/NatGov/private_sector/NGO categories",
      "confidence": "high",
      "supporting_quotes": [
        "Professor of Economics at Stanford University"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

CLASSIFICATION RULES
- When organization type is ambiguous, explain in reasoning and mark confidence as "medium" or "low"
- Some organizations have hybrid characteristics - choose primary function
- If truly uncertain between two categories, use "other" and explain
- Use organization name and context from quotes to infer type
- Confidence: "high" (clear classification), "medium" (some ambiguity), "low" (significant uncertainty)

CRITICAL RULES
- Every organization must receive exactly one classification
- Reasoning must justify the chosen category
- Do NOT leave organization_type empty
- When in doubt, use "other" rather than forcing into wrong category
