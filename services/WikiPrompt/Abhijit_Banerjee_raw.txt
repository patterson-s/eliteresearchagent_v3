Bengali
father and a
Marathi
mother in
Mumbai
.
[
1

[
9

[

]
[
11

His mother, Nirmala (née Patankar) Banerjee was a professor at the
Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta
.
[
1
]
Banerjee attended secondary school at
South Point School
in
Kolkata
, where he was described as a "brilliant" but "very quiet" student.
[
12
]
During high school, he was interested in literature, history, philosophy, and mathematics, choosing to pursue his undergraduate studies in the latter at the
Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata
.
[
1
]
He dropped out of the program after one week, transferring to
Presidency College

.
[
1

After completing his undergraduate studies, Banerjee pursued an
MA
in Economics at

, selecting to study there over the
Delhi School of Economics
because of its political life, and the latter's reputation as a stepping stone to
PhD
programs in the
United States
, which Banerjee had little interest in pursuing.
[
1
]
His teachers included
Anjan Mukherjee
and
Krishna Bharadwaj
, the latter of whom taught a course on the history of

economic thought.
[
1
]
While studying at
JNU
, Banerjee was arrested, imprisoned, and beaten at
Tihar Jail
, in response to a protest in which students
gheraoed
the then vice chancellor of the university.
[
13
]
[
14
]
He completed his degree in 1983, and was encouraged by his parents and teachers to apply for
PhD
programs in economics.
[
1
]
Banerjee applied to
Harvard
,
Stanford
, and the
University of California, Berkeley
, attending the first of these despite no students from
Jawaharlal Nehru University
having previously been admitted to the university.
[
1
]
At
Harvard
, his classmates included
Tyler Cowen
,
Alan Krueger
,
Steven Kaplan

.
[
1

,
Oliver Hart
, and
Susan Collins
, and briefly served as a research assistant to

announced that Banerjee and Duflo would be joining the faculty of the UZH Faculty of Business, Economics, and Informatics in July 2026, where they would co-direct the newly-established Lemann Center for Development, Education and Public Policy. The center and Banerjee and Duflo's endowed professorships were created following a 26 million franc (32.5 million USD) donation from Swiss-Brazilian billionaire
Jorge Paulo Lemann's
Lemann Foundation. The couple would maintain part-time positions at MIT.
[
25
]
Research and work in India
[
edit
]
Banerjee and his co-workers try to measure the effectiveness of actions (such as government programmes) in improving people's lives. For this, they use
randomized controlled trials
, similar to clinical trials in medical research.
[
26
]
For example, although
polio vaccination
is freely available in India, many mothers were not bringing their children for the vaccination drives. Banerjee and Prof. Esther Duflo, also from MIT, tried an experiment in
Rajasthan
, where they gave a bag of pulses to mothers who vaccinated their children. Soon, the immunization rate went up in the region. In another experiment, they found that learning outcomes improved in schools that were provided with teaching assistants to help students with special needs.
[
27
]
Banerjee is a co-founder of
Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab
(along with economists
Esther Duflo
and
Sendhil Mullainathan
).
[
28
]
In India he serves on the academic advisory board of
Plaksha University
, a science and technology university established in 2010.
[
29
]
[
30
]
Banerjee wrote a cookbook in 2021,
Cooking To Save Your Life
, published by Juggernaut.

Awards
[
edit
]
Abhijit Banerjee was awarded the
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
in 2019 along with his two co-researchers
Esther Duflo
and
Michael Kremer
"for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty".
[
39
]
The press release from the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
noted: "Their experimental research methods now entirely dominate
development economics
."
[
40
]
[
41
]
The Nobel committee commented:
"Banerjee, Duflo and their co-authors concluded that students appeared to learn nothing from additional days at school. Neither did spending on textbooks seem to boost learning, even though the schools in
Kenya
lacked many essential inputs. Moreover, in the Indian context Banerjee and Duflo intended to study, many children appeared to learn little: in results from field tests in the city of
Vadodara
fewer than one in five third-grade students could correctly answer first-grade curriculum math test questions.
[
41
]
"In response to such findings, Banerjee, Duflo and co-authors argued that efforts to get

more children into school must be complemented by reforms to improve school quality."
[
41
]
The Nobel Prize was a major recognition for their chosen field - Development Economics, and for the use of Randomised Controlled Trials. It evoked mixed emotions in India, where his success was celebrated with nationalistic fervour while his approach and pro-poor focus were seen as a negation of India's current government's right-wing ideology as well as broader development discourse.
[
42
]
Banerjee's achievement of the Nobel Prize was received with a cold shoulder by the
right-wing
Bharatiya Janata Party
, which is in power at the Union level in India, because he was one of the economists that were consulted by
Rahul Gandhi
in formulating an basic-income support scheme called
NYAY
, which was the main electoral promise of the
Indian National Congress
in the
2019 Indian general election
. In response to his criticism of the
Union government
's handling of the
country's economy
,
Commerce & Industries Minister
Piyush Goyal
, while speaking on Banerjee's receiving of the Nobel Prize on
Twitter
, stated that Banerjee's economic theories are based on
a leftist viewpoint
and by voting for the BJP, the Indian masses have 'totally rejected' his thoughts.
[
43
]
BJP leader Rahul Sinha, who had served as the
state BJP
president in Banerjee's native state of
West Bengal
, downplayed his achievements and alleged
Anti-Indian sentiment
on the part of the
Nobel Committee
for awarding Banerjee, who married
Esther Duflo
a non-
Indian
person, shortly a year after divorcing his Indian wife.
[
44
]
He was awarded the
Doctor of Letters
(
Honoris Causa
) by the
University of Calcutta
in January 2020.
[
45
]
Abhijit Banerjee and
Esther Duflo
received the Golden Plate Award of the
American Academy of Achievement
in September 2022.
