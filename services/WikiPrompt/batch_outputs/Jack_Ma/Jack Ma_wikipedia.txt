Jack Ma
, is a Chinese businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of the
Jack Ma Foundation
, and co-founder of
Alibaba Group
and
Yunfeng Capital
. As of May 2025, Ma's net worth was estimated at
US$
27.2 billion.

After taking the
gaokao
three times, Ma earned a bachelor’s degree in English from
Hangzhou Normal University
in 1988 and was assigned as an English and international trade lecturer at
Hangzhou Dianzi University
. Interested in internet entrepreneurship since the 1980s, he founded his first business, Hangzhou Hope Translation Agency, in 1994.
[

The following year, he created the agency’s website and then resigned from the university to establish Hangzhou Hope Computer Services Co., Ltd., one of China’s earliest internet startups, which operated an online yellow pages

service for Chinese companies. In 1996, Ma’s company was acquired by
China Telecommunications Corporation
. Following an unsatisfactory collaboration, he left the company the next year and went on to develop websites for China’s
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
. In 1999, he co-founded
Alibaba Group
, initially as a
business-to-business
(B2B)
e-commerce
marketplace and later expanded into a multinational technology conglomerate.

Ma has been regarded as a leading figure and global ambassador of Chinese business. His influence declined after Chinese regulators halted the anticipated
initial public offering
(IPO) of his digital payments company,
Ant Group
, in 2020, following his criticism of China's financial regulators for prioritizing risk control over innovation.

Early life and education
[
edit
]
Ma was born in
Hangzhou
, Zhejiang, on 10 September 1964, as
Ma Yun
.
[
10
]
He became interested in learning the
English language
as a young boy and began practicing it with English-speaking visitors who frequented the Hangzhou International Hotel. At the age of 12, Ma bought a pocket radio and began listening to English radio stations frequently. For nine years, Ma rode 27 km (17 miles) on his bicycle every day to work as a tour guide of Hangzhou for foreigners in order to practice his English. He became
pen pals
with one of those foreigners, who nicknamed him "Jack" because he found it hard to pronounce his Chinese name.
[
11
]
When Ma was 13 years old, he was forced to transfer to
Hangzhou No. 8 Middle School
as he kept getting in fights. In his primary school days, Ma struggled academically, and it took two years for him to gain acceptance at an ordinary Chinese high school, as he only got 31 points in mathematics on the Chinese high school entrance exam.
In 1980, while he was riding his bike to practice English with tourists, he met Ken Morley, who was traveling with his family with the Australia-China Friendship Society.
[
12
]
Ken's son, David, became pen pals with Ma and kept in touch after the family left China. Years later, the Morleys hosted Ma in Australia, changing the course of his life completely. Ma later said: "Those 29 days in Newcastle were crucial in my life. Without those 29 days, I would

never have been able to think the way I do today."
[
13
]
In 1982, at the age of 18, Ma failed the
Chinese college entrance exam
on his initial attempt, obtaining only 1 point in mathematics. Afterwards, he and his cousin applied to be waiters at a nearby hotel. His cousin was hired, but Ma was rejected on the grounds that he was "too skinny, too short, and in general, protruded a bad physical appearance that may have potentially ended up hurting the restaurant's image and possibly tarnishing its reputation."
[
14
]
In 1983, Ma failed his college entrance exam for the second time.
[
10
]
However, his math score improved, increasing from his previous attempt to 19 points. The following year, Ma remained relentlessly determined to pursue higher education despite strong opposition from his family, who wanted him to choose a different career path as an alternative option. Undeterred, he decided to take the entrance exam a third time in 1984. On his third attempt, Ma scored 89 points on the math section, marking a significant improvement from his previous two attempts. Nonetheless, the minimum benchmark entrance requirement would have rendered Ma ineligible to be accepted into university, since his score was five points below the standardized minimum threshold for him to qualify.
However, Ma's academic fortunes changed since the enrollment target for prospective majors in
Hangzhou Normal University
's Department of English was not met, as some prospective students had the opportunity to be accepted and promoted into it, with Ma himself having ended up being promoted to the department's foreign language major. Having realized his aspirations to pursue higher education after enrolling at Hangzhou Normal University, Ma's academic performance began to improve substantially as he steadily achieved scholarly excellence over the course of his undergraduate studies. In recognition of his merits as evinced by his burgeoning academic achievements, Ma distinguished himself scholastically by consistently being ranked as among the top five students in Hangzhou Normal University's foreign language department due to the extensive English-language skills that he honed. He was also elected as the chairman of the student union and later became the chairman of the Hangzhou Federation of Students, serving in that capacity for two terms.
[

]
In 1988, Ma earned a BA degree in English from Hangzhou Normal University.
[
15
]
[
16
]
After graduation, he became

a lecturer in English and international trade at
Hangzhou Dianzi University
. Ma also claims to have applied to
Harvard Business School
ten times consecutively, being rejected every time.

Early career
[
edit
]
According to Ma's autobiographical speech,
[
18
]
after graduating from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988, Ma applied for 31 different odd entry-level jobs and was rejected for every single one. "I went for a job with the KFC; they said, 'you're no good
'
", Ma told interviewer
Charlie Rose
. "I even went to
KFC
when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted. I was the only guy [rejected] ...".
[
16
]
[
19
]
During this period, China was nearing the end of its first decade following
Deng Xiaoping
's
economic reforms
.
In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet and also started his first company,
[
20
]
Hangzhou Haibo Translation Agency (
杭州海波翻譯社
,
Hángzhōu Hǎibō Fānyì Shè
), an online Chinese translation agency. In early 1995, he travelled abroad to the United States on behalf of the Hangzhou municipal government with colleagues who had helped introduce him to the Internet.
[
20
]
Although he found information related to beer from many countries, he was surprised to find none from China. He also tried to search for general information about China and again was surprised to find none. So he and his friend created an "ugly" website pertaining to information regarding Chinese beer.
[
21
]
He launched the website at 9:40 am, and by 12:30 pm he had received emails from prospective Chinese investors wishing to know more about him and his website. This was when Ma realized that the Internet had something great to offer. In April 1995, Ma and his business partner He Yibing (a computer instructor), opened the first office for China Pages, and Ma started their second company. On 10 May 1995, the pair registered the domain chinapages.com in the United States. Within a span of three years, China Pages cleared approximately 5,000,000 RMB in profit which at the time was equivalent to US$642,998 (approximately $1.18 million today).
Ma began building websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the United States.
[
22
]
He said that "The day we got connected to the Web, I

invited friends and TV people over to my house", and on a very slow
dial-up connection
, "we waited three and a half hours and got half a page", he recalled. "We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved the Internet existed".
[
23
]
From 1998 to 1999, Ma headed an information technology company established by the
China International Electronic Commerce Center
, a department of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
. In 1999, he quit and returned to Hangzhou with his team to establish Alibaba, a Hangzhou-based business-to-business marketplace site in his apartment with a group of 18 friends.
[
24
]
He started a new round of venture development with 500,000 yuan.
In October 1999 and January 2000,
Alibaba
won a total of a $25 million foreign
venture
seed capital
from the American investment bank,
Goldman Sachs
and the Japanese investment management conglomerate
SoftBank
.
[
20
]
The program was expected to improve the domestic Chinese e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for online Chinese enterprises to establish a presence for themselves to compete, especially fostering the growth of Chinese
small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) as well as addressing challenges surrounding
China's entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001
. Eventually, Alibaba began to show signs of profitability three years later as Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system. Since 2003, Ma established
Taobao Marketplace
,
Alipay
, Ali Mama and Lynx. After the rapid rise of Taobao, American e-commerce giant
eBay
offered to purchase the company. However, Ma rejected their offer, instead garnering support from
Yahoo
co-founder
Jerry Yang
who offered a $1 billion investment in upfront capital for the potential purpose of expanding Alibaba's corporate operations.
Chairman of Alibaba Group
[
edit
]
Ma speaking at the 2007 China Trust Global Leaders Forum
From 1999, Ma was executive chairman of Alibaba Group, which has remained one of China's most prominent high-technology holding companies in the two decades since it inception.  It has nine major subsidiaries: Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace,
Tmall
, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan,
1688.com
,
AliExpress.com
, and
Alipay
. At the annual general meeting of shareholders for Alibaba.com in May 2010, Ma announced Alibaba Group would begin in 2010 to earmark 0.3% of annual revenue to environmental protection, particularly on water- and air-quality improvement projects. Of the future

of Alibaba, he has said, "our challenge is to help more people to make healthy money, 'sustainable money', money that is not only good for themselves but also good for the society. That's the transformation we are aiming to make."
[
25
]
Despite achieving massive entrepreneurial and investment success in the Chinese high-technology industry and the fact that Alibaba is a high-technology company, Ma was never a technical expert on computer technology nor did he possess the extensive breadth of executive managerial skills and background experience or depth of technical know-how that would have nonetheless otherwise qualified him to competently run a technology company or operate as an independent technology entrepreneur on his own. Even though Ma's formal educational background and extensive training was in English rather than in a technical subject, his dearth of technical expertise did not deter him from being able to competitively distinguish himself from the average Chinese technology mogul. As Ma with his distinct profile stands out among his entrepreneurial contemporaries throughout the Chinese high-technology industry, many of whom typically have a foundational background in computer engineering and science as part of their formal academic training and educational makeup. Instead, Ma parlayed his educational background to use in an entrepreneurial context by fashioning himself as a promoter, businessman, manager, administrator, and organizer who possessed the
soft skills
,
emotional capacity
, and personality with a knack for leading and employing specialists of expert ability from every conceivable technical domain. At a press conference in 2010, Ma made clear with regards to the lack of his technical expertise by revealing to the public that he had never written a line of
computer code
, nor had ever made one sale to a customer, and that he only acquired a personal computer to do business with for the first time at the age of 33.
[
26
]
In 2011, it was announced that one of his companies had gained control of Alipay, formerly a subsidiary of Alibaba Group, so as to "comply with Chinese law governing payment companies in order to secure a license to continue operating Alipay.
[
27
]
Numerous analysts reported that Ma sold Alipay to himself below
market value
without notifying the board of Alibaba Group or the other major owners Yahoo and Softbank, while Ma stated that Alibaba Group's board of directors were aware of the transaction. The ownership dispute

was resolved by Alibaba Group, Yahoo! and Softbank in July 2011.
[
28
]
In November 2012, Alibaba's online transaction volume exceeded one trillion yuan. Ma stepped down as the chief executive officer of Alibaba on 10 May 2013, but remained as the executive chairman of the corporation. In September 2014, it was reported that Alibaba was raising over $25 billion in an
initial public offering
(IPO) on the
New York Stock Exchange
.
[
29
]
As of 2016
[update]
, Ma is the owner of Château de Sours in Bordeaux, Chateau Guerry in Côtes de Bourg and Château Perenne in Blaye, Côtes de Bordeaux.
[
30
]
Ma speaking on the future of online trade and globalization at the
World Economic Forum
in 2017
On 9 January 2017, Ma met with United States president-elect
Donald Trump
at
Trump Tower
, to discuss the potential of 1 million job openings in the following five years through the expansion of the presence of Alibaba's business interests in the United States.
[
31
]
On 8 September 2017, to celebrate Alibaba's 18th year of its establishment, Ma appeared on stage and gave a
Michael Jackson
-inspired performance. He also performed a partial rendition of
Elton John
's 1994 hit single
Can You Feel The Love Tonight
while being dressed up as a lead heavy metal singer at a 2009 Alibaba birthday event.
[
32
]
In the same month, Ma also partnered with Hong Kong business tycoon, Sir
Li Ka-shing
in a joint venture to offer a digital wallet service in Hong Kong.
[
33
]
Ma announced on 10 September 2018, that he would step down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding in the coming year.
[
34
]
Ma denied reports that he was forced to step aside by the Chinese government
[
35
]
and stated that he wants to focus on philanthropy through his foundation.
[
36
]
Daniel Zhang
would then lead Alibaba as the current executive chairman.
[

[

Ma stepped down from the board of Alibaba on 1 October 2020.
[

During tech crackdown
[
edit
]
News outlets noted a lack of public appearances from Ma between October 2020 and January 2021, coinciding with a regulatory crackdown on his businesses.
[
40
]
The
Financial Times
reported that the disappearance may have been connected to a

speech given at the annual People's Bank of China financial markets forum,
[
41
]
in which Ma criticized China's regulators and banks.
[
41
]
Ma described state banks as operating with a pawn shop mentality and criticized the
Basel Accords
as a "club for the elderly."
[
42
]
: 50
Wired
magazine suggests that Ma may have chosen to lay low during the stalled IPO period, influenced not only by government pressure but also by investors and employees within Alibaba who had lost millions due to the stalled IPO.
[
43
]
On 3 November 2020, the
Shanghai Stock Exchange
halted Ant Group's IPO.
[
42
]
: 50
According to Chinese bankers and officials, financial stability was the objective behind the intervention.
[
41
]
Their scrutiny had extended beyond Ant Group to other major players in China’s technology sector, particularly the three dominant companies collectively known as BAT - Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. These three companies have faced allegations of leveraging their substantial market power to establish monopolistic positions, using their scale to suppress competition and hinder the growth of smaller rivals.
[
43
]
Ant Group had sought to maintain a position as a technology company, although it was deriving approximately 90% of its revenue from financial services.
[
42
]
: 50
This position brought it into conflict with the
People's Bank of China
(PBOC), which since 2018 had sought to regulate Ant Group as a financial holding company.
[
42
]
: 50
After Ant Group filed for its IPO, PBOC had issued draft guidelines stating that it would regulate companies such as Ant Group as financial services companies, not tech companies.
[
42
]
: 51
During the IPO, financial regulators became even more concerned about Ant Group due to its high valuation as a tech company, increasing fears of a bubble.
[
42
]
: 51
Ma made a public appearance again on 20 January 2021, speaking via video link to a group of rural teachers at a charitable event, the annual Rural Teacher Initiative.
[
40
]
[
44
]
In May 2021, Ma resigned from the presidency of
Hupan University
, which was founded by him in 2015.
In 2022, Ma moved to
Tokyo
, Japan, largely retreating from the public life.
[
45
]
[
46
]
From May 1, 2023 to October 31, 2024, Ma had

been an invited professor at Tokyo College, a research institute at the
University of Tokyo
. His research focus was on sustainable agriculture and food production.
[
47
]
In March 2023, photos and videos of Ma touring the Yungu school in Hangzhou, China appeared on social media confirming the public appearance of the billionaire for the first time in several months. The school is funded by Alibaba and is located near the company's headquarters.
[
48
]
He was reportedly persuaded to return from abroad by premier
Li Qiang
.
[
49
]
In the same month, Alibaba Group turned into a holding company and its subsidiaries separated into six independent firms;
[
clarification needed
]
The Wall Street Journal
reported on 30 March that Ma engineered this in talks with company CEO
Daniel Zhang
while he was traveling overseas.
[
50
]
Ant Group made major changes to its ownership structure and corporate governance in January 2023.
[
42
]
: 261
That month, Ant Group announced a series of changes in shareholder voting rights, with Ma no longer the actual controller of Ant Group.
[
51
]
Ma's voting rights were reduced from 50% to 6%.
[
42
]
: 271
Following these changes, no single shareholder has a controlling stake in the company.
[
42
]
: 261
The company's board also added another independent director.
[
42
]
: 261
The Chinese government spoke positively of Ant Group's changes, including describing them as improvements in transparency and accountability.
[
42
]
: 261
In early 2024, Ma replaced
SoftBank
as Alibaba's largest shareholder.
[
52
]
On 17 February 2025, Ma attended a symposium with Chinese industry leaders, hosted by
Xi Jinping
at the
Great Hall of the People
in Beijing. While his image appeared on
Xinwen Lianbo
, his name was omitted by
Xinhua News Agency
and other state-run media, leading to mixed interpretations of his reappearance as a potential sign of rehabilitation following China's
tech crackdown
.
[

Entertainment career

On 24 September 2014, in an interview with
Taobao

, Ma attributed the
strength of American society
to the country being rooted in its "Christian cultural heritage" and expressed his belief in the importance for China to implement a positive value system in order to overcome the aftermath and legacy of the bygone
Cultural Revolution
.
[

In 2017, Ma advocated for the use of big data and AI to as a means to implement elements of a
planned economy
