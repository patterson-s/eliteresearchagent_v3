Paulus Gerardus Josephus Maria Polman
,
KBE
[
1
]
(born 11 July 1956
[
2
]
) is a Dutch businessman and author. He was the
chief executive officer
(CEO) of the British/Dutch consumer goods company
Unilever
.
[
3
]
Polman is also the co-author (with Andrew Winston) of
Net Positive: How Courageous Companies Thrive by Giving More Than They Take
.
[
4
]
While he

was the CEO of Unilever from 2009 to 2019, he set an ambitious vision to fully decouple business growth from its overall environmental footprint and increase the company’s positive social impact through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan.
[
5
]
[
6
]
During Polman’s term, he procured a return vastly superior to rivals and more than double that of the
FTSE
index.
[
7
]
In 2018, the Financial Times called Polman a "standout CEO of the past decade.”
[
8
]
In 2019 Polman, alongside Jeff Seabright, former Chief Sustainability Officer (C.S.O.) of Unilever, co-founded a new venture named Imagine to help businesses "eradicate poverty and inequality, and stem runaway climate change".
[
9
]
Imagine Consultancy was purchased by Systemiq, an environmental consultancy firm focused on essential system change, of which Polman is a board member and major shareholder, in 2022.
[
10
]
Polman was an early proponent of Net Positive investing, through which he invests in for-profit companies, whose mission is to deliver both high impact and financial returns. Polman sits on the Founders Board of TPG Rise, a $7 billion social-impact fund, alongside
Bono
and
Jeffrey Skoll
.
[
11
]
Polman is also founding Co-Chair of EQT Future, a €3 billion long-hold impact fund, alongside
Jacob Wallenberg
.
[
12
]
Polman is also an active
Venture Capital
investor having participated in several high profile fundraises for climate and mission focused companies.
[
13
]
As a result of his work championing causes around climate change, inequality and sustainability, Polman has become a prominent global figure in the push for more responsible business.
[
14
]
Early life
[
edit
]
Polman was born and grew up in the Dutch city of
Enschede
, in a Catholic family with three brothers and two sisters, the son of a tyre company executive father and a former schoolteacher mother.
[
15
]
Polman had hoped to become a doctor, but medical school places were allocated by lottery and he was not chosen.
[
15
]
Instead, he studied at the
University of Groningen
, graduating with a
BBA
/
BA
in 1977.
[
16
]
He completed his
MA
in Economics and
MBA
in Finance and International Marketing in 1979 at
University of Cincinnati
.
[
17
]
In June 2014 Polman received his honorary doctorate during the 400th anniversary of the University of Groningen.

[
18
]
In May 2018, Polman received an honorary doctorate from
George Mason University
. As the day's commencement speaker,
[
19
]
Polman declared, "Any system where too many feel they are not participating or are left behind will ultimately rebel against itself."
[
20
]
Capturing the spirit of his own sense of purpose, he continued, "The world we want will only be achieved when we choose action over indifference, courage over comfort, and solidarity over division."
Career
[
edit
]
Procter & Gamble
[
edit
]
Polman worked for
Procter & Gamble
for 27 years, starting in 1979 as a cost analyst, becoming managing director of P&G U.K. from 1995 to 1998, president of global fabric care from 1998 to 2001, and group president for Europe in 2001.
[
21
]
Nestlé
[
edit
]
Polman then joined
Nestlé
in 2006 as
chief financial officer
and in February 2008 became vice president and head of the Americas.
[
22
]
[
23
]
[
24
]
Unilever
[
edit
]
On 1 January 2009, Polman succeeded
Patrick Cescau
as
chief executive officer
of Unilever. Under Polman's leadership, Unilever has set a target to decouple its growth from its overall environmental footprint and improve its social impact through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan.
[
5
]
Polman has argued that, in a volatile world of finite resources, running a business sustainably is vital for its long-term growth
[
25
]
and also mitigates risk and reduces costs.
[
26
]
Unilever has now seen eight years of top line growth, averaging twice the rate of overall market growth, whilst improving the bottom line and delivering a total shareholder return of 290%. Bernstein's 2017 black book entitled 'European Food and HPC: 10-Year Global Market Share Analysis' rated Unilever top-of-class for absolute market share gains (ex-M&A) and a proportion of its categories with gains. It also compared medium-term operating expectations to current valuations, leading to an Outperform rating on Unilever. Some shareholders, however, have worried that Polman's focus on sustainability has become more important to him than the financial performance of Unilever after the company missed sales targets for six out of eight quarters in 2013 and 2014. Polman, who scrapped short-term targets at the company, has argued that the failure to meet targets is a result of erratic currency fluctuations and the slow-down in emerging markets since 2013.

Paul Polman has said that he has ambitions to increase the company's sales in emerging markets from the current 57% (47% in 2008) to 70% of turnover. Procter & Gamble, by contrast, make only 37% of sales in emerging markets and Nestlé 43%.
[
27
]
In 2009, Polman decided to make many significant management changes in order to improve Unilever's revenue in each of its business pillars.
In 2016, Polman's total compensation was €8.3 million including a basic salary of €1.2million and other benefits (2015, €10.2 million).
[
28
]
In 2018, Unilever supported the abolition of Dutch dividend-tax,
[
29
]
even though over 80% of Dutch citizens were against the tax-cut as it meant a loss of about 2 billion euros of tax-revenue a year for the Dutch state.
[
30
]
In October 2018, it was announced Unilever has cancelled plans to move headquarters from London to Rotterdam.
[
31
]
In November 2018, Polman announced he was stepping down as chief executive officer of Unilever at the end of 2018 with
Alan Jope
succeeding him.
[
32
]
Systemiq / Imagine World
[
edit
]
In July 2019, Polman announced the formation of a new group - Imagine World - to help combat poverty and climate change.
[
9
]
The foundation and corporation aims to help companies meet UN global goals for sustainable development. Imagine World was acquired by Systemiq in 2022 of which Polman remains a board member as well as major shareholder.
[
10
]
Systemiq, a certified
B-Corporation
, is a world leading environmental consultancy firm focused on managing and promoting responsible change as well as performing cutting edge research on climate topics. With over 400 consultants, they connect people, ideas, technologies and capital as part of a systems change platform.
