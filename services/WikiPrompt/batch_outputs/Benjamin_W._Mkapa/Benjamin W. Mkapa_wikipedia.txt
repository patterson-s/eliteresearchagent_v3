Benjamin William Mkapa
(12 November 1938
[
1
]
– 23 July 2020)
[
2
]
was the third
president of Tanzania
, in office from 1995 to 2005. He was Chairman of the Revolutionary State Political Party (
Chama Cha Mapinduzi
, CCM).
[

Early life
[
edit
]
Mkapa was born in Lupaso, near
Masasi
, Tanganyika, on 12 November 1938.
[
1
]
[
4
]
He graduated from
Makerere University
in
Uganda
in 1962 with a
Bachelor of Arts
in English.
[
1
]
He went on to study at
Columbia University
the following year, and earned a master's degree in International Affairs.
[
5
]
Previous posts include being an administrative officer in
Dodoma
and the Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education. Mkapa was the head of the Tanzanian mission to Canada in 1982 and to the
United States
in 1983–84.
[
6
]
He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1977 to 1980 and

again from 1984 to 1990, before meeting his best friend Edward Mwassaga.

Presidency
[
edit
]
Mkapa meeting with
Indian president
Abdul Kalam
in
Dar es Salaam
on 11 September 2004
In 1995, Mkapa was elected as president based on a popular anti-corruption campaign and the strong support of former president
Julius Nyerere
. Mkapa's anti-corruption efforts included creation of an open forum called the Presidential Commission on Corruption (Warioba Commission) and increased support for the Prevention of Corruption Bureau.
[
8
]
His second five-year term of office as president ended in December 2005. During this term in office, Mkapa privatized state-owned corporations and instituted free market policies.
[
9
]
His supporters argued that attracting foreign investment would promote economic growth. His policies won the support of the
World Bank
and
International Monetary Fund
and resulted in the cancellation of some of Tanzania's
foreign debts
.
[
8
]
He was criticized for some ineffectiveness of his anti-corruption efforts
[
8
]
as well as for his lavish spending. He spent £15 million on a private presidential jet, as well as almost £30 million on military aviation equipment from
BAE Systems
, which experts deemed beyond the limited needs of the country's armed forces.
[
10
]
It was over the latter purchase that
British
International Development Secretary
Clare Short
expressed public outrage, resulting in her becoming known as 'Mama Radar' in the Tanzanian press.
[
11
]
Post-presidency
[
edit
]
Mkapa at the 2010 World Economic Forum in Africa
Having left office due to a two-term limit, Mkapa was dogged by many accusations of corruption, among them improperly appropriating to himself and his former finance Minister
Daniel Yona
the lucrative Kiwira coal mine in the southern highlands of Tanzania without following lawful procedures. For privatizing the mine to himself, he was accused of a breach of the Tanzanian constitution, which does not allow a president to do business at the state house.
[
12
]
In 2007, Mkapa was part of the
African Union's
Panel of Eminent African Personalities, who were deployed to
Kenya
to resolve
political violence
that had broken out due to disputed election results. Mkapa - along with humanitarian and former First Lady of
Mozambique
and
South Africa
,
Graça Machel
and former
UN Secretary-General
,
Kofi Annan
(Chair) - led the group in mediation efforts that resulted in the

signing of the
National Accord and Reconciliation Act of 2008
.
[
13
]
Mkapa served as a trustee of the
Aga Khan University
from 2007 to 2012.
[
9
]
Death
[
edit
]
Mkapa suffered from malaria and treated on 22 July 2020. He died of heart attack in Dar Es Salaam in the early hours of 23 July at the age of 81.
[
14
]
Tanzanian President,
John Pombe Magufuli
, announced his death. The last farewell was conducted by Tanzania People's Defense Forces. He was laid to rest in his hometown of Lupaso, Masasi.
[
15
]
In recognition of the role Mkapa played in resolving Kenya's 2007/2008 post-election violence, Kenyan President,
Uhuru Kenyatta
, declared a three-day period of national mourning following his death, ordering all flags at public buildings and grounds to fly at
half-mast
.
