. He has served on a number of major international commissions and panels, including as co-chair of the
International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
(2000–01) and the
International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament
(2008–10). Evans has written extensively on
international relations
and legal, constitutional and political affairs, and has been internationally recognised for his contributions to the theory and practice of mass atrocity and conflict prevention, arms control and disarmament.

Oxford in 1975, joining the centrist
Labor Unity
faction and working closely with its leaders including
Clyde Holding
, Peter Redlich and Ian Turner  – and Bob Hawke, whose ambition to lead the party he strongly supported.  He was an unsuccessful Labor candidate for the Senate in 1975, but was elected in 1977 and took his seat in 1978.
[
6
]
Parliamentary and ministerial career
[
edit
]
Opposition, 1978–1983
[
edit
]
As a young backbencher, Evans was one of the two parliamentarians chosen to sit – along with international architects
I. M. Pei
and
John Andrews
– on the Parliament House Competition Assessment Panel which in 1979 chose the winning design for the new
Australian Parliament House
.
[
7
]
In his first years in the Senate, Evans focused strongly on legal and constitutional reform issues, attracting early attention with his series of attacks on
Sir Garfield Barwick
, for potential conflict of interest between his role as the
Chief Justice
of the
High Court
and his involvement in his family company Mundroola. After the October 1980 election he was promoted to the Opposition front bench in 1980, becoming Shadow Attorney-General.
[
6
]
Evans played an active part in ALP National Conferences during this period seeking to modernize the party's platform, in particular the language of the "socialist objective", and within the Parliamentary Party in developing a detailed "transition to government" strategy. He supported Bob Hawke's leadership challenge against
Bill Hayden
in 1982 which led ultimately to Hayden resigning just hours before
Malcolm Fraser
announced the March
1983 election
and Hawke leading Labor to victory.
Attorney-General, 1983–1984
[
edit
]
As Attorney-General, Evans undertook a large agenda for law reform on a range of issues. He immediately ran into controversy, arranging for the
Royal Australian Air Force
to take surveillance photos of the
Franklin Dam
project in
Tasmania
. The Hawke government was pledged to (and ultimately did) stop the project, over the objections of the Tasmanian Liberal government, on the ground that it endangered a
World Heritage
listed area. The Hawke government was accused of misusing the RAAF for domestic political purposes, and Evans's use of RAAF planes led to his earning the nickname "
Biggles
", after
Captain W. E. Johns's
fictional aviation hero – a self-inflicted wound, following his remark to journalists at the time "whatever you do, don't call me Biggles".

This incident also led to Evans coining the expression "streaker's defence" (i.e. "it seemed like a good idea at the time"), which has entered the Australian vocabulary.
[
8
]
More serious controversy surrounded the Government's handling of national security issues including the
Combe-Ivanov affair
and the attempted suppression of publication of leaked documents by journalist Brian Toohey, and the allegations of impropriety made against High Court Justice Lionel Murphy, all of which created stress for Evans as an avowed civil libertarian. He achieved a number of reforms, including the establishment of the
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
and the
National Crime Authority
, the strengthening of the Family Law and
Freedom of Information Act
, and some business regulation changes, but failed in his attempts to achieve uniform national
defamation
law, a legislative bill of rights, and constitutional reform. In a demotion following this mixed record, Hawke moved him to the less sensitive portfolio of Resources and Energy after the
1984 election
.
[
9
]
Resources, energy, transport and communications, 1984–1988
[
edit
]
In the two major industry portfolios he held over the next five years, Evans was generally perceived as playing himself back into the government mainstream. As
Minister for Resources and Energy
from 1984 to 1987
[
6
]
he won industry support for his role in rescuing from possible collapse of the huge
North West Shelf
gas project, managing the Australian fallout from the
crash in world oil prices in 1986
, and seeking to strike a workable balance, between resource sector and competing interests, on
uranium
mining, the environment and Aboriginal land rights.
In February 1987, shortly after his appointment as
Manager of Government Business in the Senate
, Evans caused controversy by making comments comparing a Senate debate to rape, stating "that if rape is inevitable, one might as well if not enjoy it, at least succumb with such grace as one can muster in the circumstances". His ALP colleague
Susan Ryan
asked him to withdraw the comment, but he refused to do so.
[
10
]
The Canberra Rape Crisis Centre requested that Evans apologise and staged a protest in the public gallery of the Senate two days later. On the same day, Evans caused further controversy by comparing three female Liberal senators to a
half-back line
and stated that they were among "things [that] frighten me". In a personal explanation

to the Senate he said his remarks were a throwaway line and that he "did not say, nor would I ever say, in jest or otherwise, that rape could ever be enjoyed".
[
11
]
As
Transport and Communications
minister in 1987–88,
[
6
]
he was involved in some controversy with the
Australian Broadcasting Commission
over funding guarantees and charter reform, but primarily concerned with issues at the heart of the government's micro-economic strategy: major airline deregulation, and the reform of government business enterprises in the telecommunications and other sectors, designed to corporatize their commercial practices, as a necessary prelude to the privatisation that later followed.
[
12
]
Minister for Foreign Affairs, 1988–1996
[
edit
]
Evans was appointed Foreign Minister in September 1988,
[
6
]
after his predecessor
Bill Hayden
retired to become
Governor-General
. He held the position for seven years and six months, the longest-serving Labor minister in that portfolio, since
Evatt
. He became a well-known Foreign Minister and highly regarded internationally, and continues to be regarded as one of Australia's most successful.
[
13
]
[
14
]
The Hawke and Keating governments were committed to shifting emphasis from Australia's traditional relationships with the
United States
and the United Kingdom to increased involvement with
Asian
neighbours, particularly
Indonesia
and
China
, and were strongly committed to multilateral diplomacy both globally and regionally.
Evans brought a strongly structured and analytical approach to foreign policymaking and is credited with significant innovative thinking in his articulation, in particular, of the concepts of middle power and niche diplomacy, "good international citizenship" as a national interest, and cooperative security (see "Contributions to international relations thinking", below).
His most widely acknowledged successes as foreign minister were his initiation of the UN peace plan for
Cambodia
,
[
15
]
and the roles that he and Australia played in bringing to fruition the International
Chemical Weapons Convention
and establishing both the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum and the
ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF). Major contributions to international agenda setting, though not bearing much immediate fruit, were his book on UN reform
[
16
]
launched in
New York City
in 1993, and his initiation with Paul Keating of the
Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons
.
In 1990, Evans famously became the first person to drop the
f-bomb
in the
Australian Parliament
, interjecting "for fuck's sake"

during a speech by
Senator Robert Hill
.
[
17
]
Despite his reputation as a negotiator he was widely reputed to be in possession of a short-temper with a particular intolerance for elected representatives of the
Australian Greens
.

Les Aspin
(right) in 1993.
Evans ran into significant controversy on two major issues: relations with Indonesia over
East Timor
and
French Nuclear Tests
in the
Pacific
. Evans continues to be strongly criticised by many commentators – most prominently
Noam Chomsky
and
John Pilger
[
22
]
– for supporting Australia's recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor following its
military invasion in 1975
, negotiating (and celebrating "replete with champagne") with then Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas
the
Timor Gap Treaty
, and describing the 1991
Dili massacre
as "an aberration, not an act of state policy".  Evans has replied at length to these charges in various forums,
[
23
]
acknowledging that the Indonesian military's behaviour had been appalling and conceding that Australia had been too optimistic about its capacity for redemption, but arguing, that
de jure
recognition by Australian (and other) governments had never denied the continuing right of the East Timorese to self-determination; that he personally had worked hard (as subsequently acknowledged by
José Ramos-Horta
)
[
24

to achieve real autonomy for East Timor as the only realistic option before the events of 1997; and that independent East Timor had fully inherited the benefits of the Timor Gap Treaty. The Timor Gap Treaty was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty after East Timor's independence in 2002. However, after the
Australia-East Timor spying scandal
came to light, East Timor terminated the treaties, which were favorable to Australia. In 2018, the treaty in force today was concluded, which is far more favorable to East Timor.
When in June 1995 the resumption of French underground nuclear tests at
Moruroa Atoll
was announced, Evans generated a storm of press and public criticism for remarking that while Australia deplored the decision "it could have been worse". This was strictly accurate as the test series was limited in number, and France promised to then permanently close the test facility and join the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
negotiations, but it politically damaged Evans and his party.
Leader of the

government in the Senate, 1993–1996
[
edit
]
In 1993, as a member of the Keating government, Senator Evans became Leader of the Government in the Senate,
[
6
]
replacing the retiring
John Button
, whose Deputy he had been since 1987.  In this position he led the government's domestic legislative agenda in the upper house, where the government did not have a majority, and every bill had to be negotiated with the minor parties.  In what was described at the time as "perhaps the finest moment in his political career",
[
25
]
he played the leading role in getting the government's
Native Title Act 1993
through the Senate in one of the Parliament's longest-ever debates
[
26
]
following the High Court of Australia's decision in
Mabo v Queensland
.
Return to opposition, 1996–1999
[
edit
]
Evans had long desired to move from the Senate to the
House of Representatives
, where he hoped to pursue leadership ambitions. His first attempt to do so, in 1984, had been thwarted by the
Socialist Left
faction, but in 1995 he gained endorsement for the seat of
Holt
, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, and was elected at the
1996 election
. He was elected Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, defeating
Simon Crean
, and appointed Shadow Treasurer by Leader
Kim Beazley
. As Deputy Leader Evans led a major policy review in every shadow portfolio area, and during 1997 orchestrated in secret the defection to the Labor Party of the popular leader of the
Australian Democrats
, Senator
Cheryl Kernot
, who resigned from the Senate in October and became a Labor House of Representatives candidate at the
1998 election
. The political triumph of the defection was, however, soured by the later revelation – by
Laurie Oakes
in his column in
The Bulletin
in 2002 – that Evans and Kernot had been having an affair at the time.
[
27
]
Evans, after eighteen years in the Senate, found the transition to the much rowdier and fast-paced lower house environment not easy to manage, and – with Australia sailing comfortably through the
1997 Asian financial crisis
– also found it difficult to get traction with his own economic policy brief. He also did not enjoy the move to opposition after thirteen years in government, coining the expression "relevance deprivation syndrome", which  – while he was criticised more

than applauded for his honesty at the time – is now entrenched in the national vocabulary.
[
28
]
His biographer, Keith Scott, commented that "Overwhelmingly, Evans's period as deputy leader and shadow treasurer – from March 1996 to October 1998 – was his least successful in federal parliament".
[
29
]
Labor's defeat at the 1998 election led to Evans's resignation from the opposition front bench, and in September 1999 he resigned from Parliament causing a
by-election
, which was later won by Labor candidate
Anthony Byrne
.
Throughout his time as a member of both houses of Parliament, Evans served in three of the four leadership positions, deputy Senate leader, Senate leader and deputy leader in the House of Representatives.

International activity after politics
[
edit
]
International Crisis Group
[
edit
]
In 1994, while Foreign Minister of Australia, Evans committed his government to donate $500,000 as initial funding
[
30
]
for
Brussels
-based conflict prevention and resolution organisation, the
International Crisis Group
(ICG).
From 2000 to 2009 Evans was president and CEO of the ICG, which during his tenure grew in staff from 25 to over 130, in budget from $US2 million to over $15 million, and in operating area from a handful of countries in the Balkans and Central Africa to over 60 across four continents, and published 784 worldwide-distributed reports.
[
31
]
Evans at the
London School of Economics
as the guest lecturer on human rights in 2000.
The ICG made important contributions during this period in early-warning bellringing in cases like
Darfur
and
Ethiopia-Eritrea
, supporting conflict mediation in situations like
Southern Sudan
,
Kosovo
and
Aceh
, making path-breaking recommendations on
Israel-Palestine
,
Iran
and
Burma
/Myanmar, analysing the different strands of
Islamism
, and generally providing timely and detailed field-based analysis and recommendations to policymakers on hundreds of separate conflict-related issues.
Although subject to occasional attack for the positions it has taken,
[
32
]
the ICG was firmly established by the time of Evans's departure, and has remained, the preeminent international NGO working on the prevention and resolution of deadly conflict, praised by leaders across the spectrum from
Condoleezza Rice
to
Hillary Clinton
, and regularly being identified as one of the world's most influential think tanks.
[
33
]
The responsibility to protect
[
edit
]
In 2000–2001 Evans co-chaired, with
Mohamed Sahnoun
,

the
International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
(ICISS), appointed by the government of Canada to address the issue of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes, which published its report,
The Responsibility to Protect
, in December 2001.
The co-chairs then wrote an article on this matter: a state's sovereignty is also under question in times of mass murder, in terms of legitimacy. Sovereignty is dependent upon the state's responsibility to its people; if not fulfilled, then the contract between the government and its citizen is void, thus the sovereignty is not legitimate. In that crucible lies the genesis of the
Responsibility to protect
(R2P) doctrine.
[
34
]
The core idea of the R2P doctrine, as endorsed by the
United Nations General Assembly
at the
2005 World Summit
, is that every state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide and other mass atrocity crimes; the international community has a responsibility to assist the state if it is unable to protect its population on its own; and that if the state fails to protect its citizens from mass atrocities and peaceful measures have failed, the international community has the responsibility to intervene with appropriate measures, with coercive military intervention, approved by the UN
Security Council
, available as a last resort.  The concept was expressly designed to supersede the idea of "humanitarian intervention", which had failed to generate any international consensus about how to respond to the 1990s catastrophes of
Rwanda
,
Bosnia
and
Kosovo
.
Evans has been widely acknowledged
[
35
]
as playing a crucial role in initiating, and advocating the international acceptance of, the concept, first as co-chair of the
International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
which introduced the expression in its 2001 report of that name, and subsequently as a member of the UN Secretary-General's High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, Co-Chair of the Advisory Board of the
Global Centre on the Responsibility to Protect
, a member of the Editorial Board of the journal
Global Responsibility to Protect
and as the author of the Brookings Institution-published
The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and For All
and many other published works. He has made innumerable speeches and presentations on the issue, including in July 2009 participating at the UNGA in an interactive dialogue with
Noam Chomsky
.

Academic career and published writing
[
edit
]
Before entering Australian politics Evans was a lecturer, then senior lecturer, in law at the
University of Melbourne
, teaching constitutional and civil liberties law, crime and torts, from 1971 to 1976. In 2009, after his retirement from politics and his subsequent career as head of the International Crisis Group, he returned to academic life as an honorary professorial fellow (later professorial fellow) in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne, teaching a graduate course on international policymaking in practice in 2011 and 2012.
He was elected as chancellor of the
Australian National University
(ANU) from 1 January 2010,
[
52
]
replacing
Kim Beazley
following Beazley's appointment as Australian Ambassador to the United States. Evans was installed by Governor-General
Quentin Bryce
at a ceremony in Canberra on 18 February 2010, and served until 1 January 2020.
He is also elected an Honorary Fellow of
Magdalen College
, Oxford in 2024; and since 2020 has been Distinguished Honorary Professor at ANU; he is also a Distinguished Fellow of the Australia India Institute at the University of Melbourne. Evans has maintained strong academic and scholarly connections throughout his career, lecturing at many universities around the world, including Oxford, Cambridge (where he delivered the 2013 Humanitas Lectures on Statecraft and Diplomacy), Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Indiana and the Central European University in Budapest.
[
53
]
Evans has written or edited 14 books, most recently
Good International Citizenship: The Case for Decency
(Monash Publishing, 2022). His other major works include
Incorrigible Optimist: A Political Memoir
(Melbourne University Press, 2017),
Inside the Hawke Keating Government: A Cabinet Diary
(Melbourne University Press, 2014),
The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and for All
(Brookings Institution

Press, September 2008, paperback edition 2009),
[
54

which was awarded an Honorable Mention in the US Council on Foreign Relations Arthur Ross Book Award 2009 as one of the best three books on international relations published in the previous year, as well as
Australia's Foreign Relations
(with
Bruce Grant
, Melbourne University Press 1991, 2nd ed 1995),
Cooperating for Peace: The Global Agenda for the 1990s
(Allen & Unwin, 1993),
Australia's Constitution
(with
John McMillan
and Haddon Storey, Allen & Unwin, 1983) and the edited collection,
Labor and the Constitution
, 1972–1975 (Heinemann, 1977). He co-edited the annual
Labor Essays
series from 1980 to 1982.
Evans has also published nearly 150 chapters in books, monographs and articles in refereed and other journals – and many more newspaper and magazine articles – on foreign relations, politics, human rights and legal reform.
[
55
]
Contributions to international relations thinking
[
edit
]
Good international citizenship
[
edit
]
Evans introduced the idea of "good international citizenship" in his first major speeches as Australian foreign minister, and repeated and refined it in subsequent writing,
[
56
]
most recently his monograph
Good International Citizenship: The Case for Decency
(Monash Publishing, 2022). The core notion was that "being, and being seen to be, a good international citizen" should be seen not as the "foreign policy equivalent of boy-scout good deeds", but as a distinct component of any country's national interest, "quite distinct from the familiar duo of security and economic interests":
The interest in question here is more than just the pleasure of basking in approbation. There are many direct reciprocal benefits to be gained in a world where no country can solve all its own problems: my assistance for you today in solving your drugs and terrorism problem might reasonably lead you to be more willing to help solve my environmental problem tomorrow. But the reputational benefit does also count. The perception of being a country willing to take principled stands for other than immediately self-interested reasons does no harm at all – as the Scandinavians in particular seem to have well understood – when it comes to advancing one's own commercial or political agendas.
[
57
]
The concept of "good international citizenship" has been specifically attributed to Evans in academic writing; its "idealistic pragmatism" has been seen as a way of bridging or transcending rival doctrines of realism

and idealism in international relations theory; and the idea has been advanced as mapping a possible "third way for British foreign policy".
[
58
]
Niche diplomacy
[
edit
]
"Niche diplomacy" was identified by Evans as one of the characteristic methods of the larger and more familiar concept of
middle power
diplomacy which has traditionally characterized the approach to international relations of Canada (especially during the
Pearson
years) and Australia (especially under the Labor governments of Hawke, Keating and
Rudd
).
[
59
]
He defined it as "concentrating resources in specific areas best able to generate returns worth having, rather than trying to cover the field. By definition, middle powers are not powerful enough in most circumstances to impose their will, but they may be persuasive enough to have likeminded others see their point of view, and to act accordingly".
[
60
]
The concept is now familiar in academic discourse, and has been specifically attributed to Evans.
[
61
]
Cooperative security
[
edit
]
Evans won the 1995
Grawemeyer Award
for Ideas Improving World Order (following
Mikhail Gorbachev
the year before) for his fall 1994
Foreign Policy
article, "Cooperative Security and Intra-State Conflict", which was cited as presenting ideas that, following the end of the
Cold War
"could quicken the process ... to help maintain a new world order". He described "cooperative security" as being a single conceptual theme that effectively captured the essence of three more familiar concepts in international security discourse, viz. comprehensive security, common security and
collective security
. Its defining – and attractive – characteristics were that "the term tends to connote consultation rather than confrontation, reassurance rather than deterrence, transparency rather than secrecy, prevention rather than correction, and interdependence rather than unilateralism".
[
62
]
Honours and awards
[
edit
]
On 11 June 2012, Evans was named a Companion of the
Order of Australia
for "eminent service to international relations, particularly in the Asia Pacific Region as an adviser to governments on a range of global policy matters, to conflict prevention and resolution, and to arms control and disarmament."
[
63
]
He had previously been made an Officer of the
Order of Australia
(AO) in 2001 for "service to the Australian Parliament, particularly through advancing Australia's foreign policy and trade interests, especially in Asia and through the United Nations", and has been awarded Honorary Doctorates of Laws by the

University of Melbourne in 2002,
Carleton University
in 2005, the
University of Sydney
in 2008 and
Queen's University
Ontario in 2010. In October 2005 he and the International Crisis Group were named European and Asian "Heroes of 2005".
[
64
]
In July 2008, he was selected as an inaugural fellow of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in recognition of his "outstanding contribution to Australian international relations". In May 2010 he was awarded the 2010
Roosevelt Institute
Four Freedoms Award
for Freedom from Fear for his pioneering work on the responsibility to protect concept and his contributions to conflict prevention and resolution, arms control and disarmament. In October 2011, he was presented by the
Nuclear Threat Initiative
, led by
Sam Nunn
and
Ted Turner
, the
Amartya Sen
Award "for intrepid and creative leadership in creating momentum toward a world free of nuclear weapons". In December 2011
Foreign Policy
magazine cited him, along with
Francis Deng
, as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2011 "for making 'the responsibility to protect' more than academic".
[
65
]
In 2012 Evans was elected an honorary fellow of the
Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia
.
[
66
]
In 2016 he was awarded the Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop Asialink Medal "for long-term commitment to enhancing the quality of life in the region and improving Australia-Asia relations". In March 2017 he received the Canadian Simons Foundation Award for Distinguished Global Leadership in the Service of Peace and Disarmament. In May 2023 he was given the ROK Jeju 4.3 Peace Award for his significant contribution over three decades to promoting peace, reconciliation and human rights as foreign minister, NGO head, international commission member, writer and advocate.
[
67
]
Earlier in his career he was designated Australian Humanist of the Year in 1990 by the
Council of Australian Humanist Societies
, won the ANZAC Peace Prize in 1994 for his "leadership role in the Cambodian Peace Process", was awarded in 1995 the prestigious
University of Louisville
$150 000
Grawemeyer Prize for Ideas Improving World Order
for his 1994
Foreign Policy
article "Cooperative Security and Intrastate Conflict", and in 1999 received the
Chilean Order of Merit
(Grand Officer) for his work in initiating
APEC
