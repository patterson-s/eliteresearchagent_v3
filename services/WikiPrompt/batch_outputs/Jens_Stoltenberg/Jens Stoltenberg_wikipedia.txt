Jens Stoltenberg
(
Norwegian:
[jɛns
ˈstɔ̀ɫtn̩bærɡ]
; born 16 March 1959) is a Norwegian politician who has served as the
Minister of Finance
since 2025, a position he previously held from 1996 to 1997. A member of the
Labour Party
, he has also previously served as the
prime minister of Norway
from 2000 to 2001 and 2005 to 2013, and
secretary general of NATO
from 2014 to 2024.
Born in
Oslo
as the son of diplomat and politician
Thorvald Stoltenberg
and politician
Karin Stoltenberg
(
née
Heiberg
), Stoltenberg attended
Oslo Waldorf School
and
Oslo Cathedral School
before graduating with a degree in economics from the
University of Oslo
in 1987. During his studies, he worked as a journalist, and led Labour's
youth wing
from 1985 to 1989.
Stoltenberg started his career in government as a
state secretary
in the
Ministry of the Environment
in 1990 and was elected to the
Storting
in 1993. He was the
Minister of Industry and Energy
from 1993 to

1996 and
Minister of Finance
from 1996 to 1997. He was prime minister from 2000 to 2001, leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2014, and was prime minister for a second time from 2005 to 2013. The following year, he was named as the 13th secretary general of
NATO
, and his term was subsequently extended four times by the NATO heads of state and government.
Stoltenberg has been described as a cautious politician, belonging to the right wing of social democracy. When he became prime minister in 2000, he was portrayed as the "Norwegian
Tony Blair
", and his policies were inspired by Blair's
New Labour
agenda. As the second longest-serving high-ranking official in NATO history, Stoltenberg worked to expand the alliance into Eastern Europe and to strengthen the alliance's military capabilities in response to the
Russo-Ukrainian War
, and his tenure coincided with the largest increase in NATO defense spending since the
Cold War
.
On 4 February 2025, after the
Centre Party
withdrew from the
Støre Cabinet
, Stoltenberg returned to
Norwegian politics
by being appointed as the new Minister of Finance, succeeding
Trygve Slagsvold Vedum
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Stoltenberg was born 16 March 1959 in
Oslo
, into the Norwegian
Stoltenberg family
, the family name derived from
Stoltenberg
in Schleswig-Holstein where a German ancestor once lived. Jens's father,
Thorvald Stoltenberg
(1931–2018), was a Labour party politician and diplomat who was an ambassador, defence minister and foreign minister. His mother,
Karin Stoltenberg
(née Heiberg; 1931–2012), was a geneticist who was the
state secretary
in multiple governments during the 1980s.
[

]
Marianne Heiberg
, married to former foreign minister
Johan Jørgen Holst
, was his maternal aunt. Jens lived in
SFR Yugoslavia
from 1961 to 1964 while his father worked at the Norwegian embassy.
[

[

Stoltenberg attended primary school at
Oslo Waldorf School
, and upper secondary school at
Oslo Cathedral School
. He served his mandatory military service with the Army's Infantry Training Centre at
Evjemoen
in
Aust-Agder
. After leaving the army, Stoltenberg enrolled at the
University of Oslo
, graduating in 1987 with the
cand.oecon.
degree in economics. The title of his thesis was
Makroøkonomisk planlegging under usikkerhet. En empirisk analyse
("Macroeconomic planning under uncertainty. An
empirical analysis
").
[

]
Stoltenberg's first steps into politics came in his early teens,

when he was influenced by his sister
Camilla
, who at the time was a member of the then
Marxist–Leninist
group
Red Youth
. Opposition to the
Vietnam War
was his triggering motivation. Following heavy
bombing raids
against the North Vietnamese port city of
Hai Phong
at the end of the Vietnam War, he participated in
protest rallies
targeting the
United States Embassy in Oslo
. On at least one occasion embassy windows were broken by stone-throwing protesters. Several of Stoltenberg's friends were arrested by the police after these events.

Journalistic career (1979–1990)
[
edit
]
From 1979 to 1981, Stoltenberg was a journalist for
Arbeiderbladet
. From 1985 to 1989, he was the leader of the
Workers' Youth League
. From 1989 to 1990, he worked as an executive officer for
Statistics Norway
, Norway's central institution for producing official statistics. He also worked part-time as an hourly paid instructor at the University of Oslo during this period. Between 1990 and 1992, he was leader of the
Oslo
chapter of the Labour Party.
[

Up to 1990, he had regular contacts with a Soviet diplomat. He ended this relationship after being informed by the
Norwegian Police Security Service
that his contact was a
KGB
agent, warning him against further contact. The code name given to Stoltenberg by the KGB was "Steklov".

On 29 September 1997, Jagland resigned because of
an ultimatum
he had issued stating that the cabinet would resign if the party received less than 36.9% of the popular vote.
[

Labour only received 35.0%; true to his promise, Jagland resigned as a consequence of its
36.9 ultimatum
, and power was transferred

to the
first cabinet of Kjell Magne Bondevik
.
[

[

After Jagland's resignation and while in parliamentary opposition, Stoltenberg served on the standing committee on Oil and Energy Affairs in the
Storting

Stoltenberg's first cabinet governed Norway from 17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001.
[
12
]
Stoltenberg was the
deputy leader
of the Labour Party while Jagland was the
party leader
. Instead Jagland was given the post as
Foreign Minister
. Stoltenberg's first tenure as Prime Minister (2000–2001) was controversial within his own party, being responsible for reforms and modernisation of the
welfare state
that included partly privatising several key state-owned services and corporations.
[
13
]
In the
parliamentary election
of 10 September 2001, the party suffered one of its worst results ever, winning only 24% of the vote.
The 2001 election met with instability for the Labour Party. The Norwegian newspaper
Dagbladet
stated: "We are heading for a political earthquake when the votes are counted tonight, if we believe the opinion polls."
[
14
]
In an interview with
The Associated Press
Jagland stated "It is unstable and unpredictable."
[
14
]
After the election in 2001, Stoltenberg and his cabinet were forced to resign, with the Labour Party suffering from its worst election campaign results since 1924.
[
15
]
With the 98% votes taken, the Labour Party only garnered 24%, falling from 35%.
[
15
]
Jagland, the Labour Party leader, commented on the results saying, "We will have to make a decision about whether to continue in government after we know the full results".
[
15
]
After the election Stoltenberg said, "What is clear is that this was a very bad election."
[
15
]
Some analysts
[
citation needed
]
have pointed out that one of the causes for their loss was that with only one year in power until the next election, more time was spent

initiating or trying to start reforms than telling the people why they had to be done. Such reforms included selling down in state-owned companies, re-organisation of health care and public hospitals and changes in sick pay. The changes made from the 2001 election to the 2005 election were described by Norwegian newspaper
VG
as an "extreme makeover".
[

]
Party leader election
[
edit
]
The bad election result in 2001 was quickly followed by a leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators as a sign that he probably would seek the leadership position.
[
17
]
In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave,
[
18

said that he would not seek reelection as leader.
[

In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.

Stoltenberg speaks on

at Youngstorget in Oslo on 1 May 2009.
Main article:
Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet
Stoltenberg's second cabinet governed Norway from 17 October 2005 to 16 October 2013. The
2005 parliamentary election
saw a vast improvement for Labour, and the party gained a majority in parliament together with the other "Red-Green" parties, the
Socialist Left Party
and the
Centre Party
. This paved the way for a historic first in Norway, with Labour joining in a coalition government, the
Red-Green Coalition
, after a
coalition deal
with Stoltenberg was struck. Since the government's formation, key political issues such as
Norwegian military
participation in the
war in Afghanistan
, petroleum activities in the
Barents Sea
,
LGBT
rights, immigration and the quality of standard education were greatly debated by the public. Following
Stoltenberg's re-election in 2009
, he worked on the Norwegian response to the
ongoing global recession
and championed for
environmentalist policies
through private and corporate taxation.
[

Stoltenberg with Russian president
Dimitry Medvedev
, 27 April 2010
A
marine border dispute with Russia
in the Barents Sea since 1978 was settled when Stoltenberg and
President of Russia
Dimitry Medvedev
signed an

agreement on 27 April 2010 in Oslo.
[
22
]
[
23
]
The agreement is a compromise, which divides a disputed area of around 175,000 km
2
(68,000 sq mi) into two approximately equally sized parts.
[
24
]
However, the agreement still needs ratification by the
State Duma
and the
Parliament of Norway
in order to be implemented. Whereas Norway had previously insisted on a border in accordance with the
equidistance principle
, which is recognized in international law, specifically the
United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea
Article 15 and the
Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone
Article 6, Russia invoked a
Stalin
-era decree of the
Soviet Union
from 1926, which was not recognised by any other country. The new agreement replaced a controversial
[
25
]
temporary agreement negotiated by
Jens Evensen
and
Arne Treholt
, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy and who aided the Soviet Union in the negotiations.
[
26
]
Most of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered Norwegian according to the relevant international treaties.
As Prime Minister, Stoltenberg worked for a constructive
relationship with Russia
through dialogue and cooperation underpinned by NATO's deterrence and defence capabilities. During his tenure, he also emphasised the need to focus on security challenges close to Allied territory.

22 July 2011 terrorist attacks

Main article:
2011 Norway attacks
Stoltenberg speaks at a service commemorating the one year anniversary of the 2011 attacks.
On 22 July 2011, a far-right extremist committed
two attacks
: a bomb went off in
Oslo
outside the government building which houses the prime minister's office, killing eight people while wounding others.
[
28
]
About an hour later, he shot and killed 69 people at
Utøya
, an island forty-five minutes away where the ruling Labour Party was holding its annual youth camp. The PM was due for a visit at the youth camp the next day, and was in his residence preparing his speech at the time of the Oslo explosion.
[
29
]
On Sunday 24 July, Stoltenberg spoke at the church service in the
Oslo Cathedral
. He named two of the victims at Utøya, Monica Bøsei, who was the camp's leader, and Tore Eikeland, who was the leader of the youth chapter in Hordaland. He again vowed to work for

more democracy, openness, and humanity, but without naïveté.
[
30
]
He also said that "No one has said it better than the AUF girl who was interviewed by CNN:
If one man can show so much hate, think how much love we could show, standing together.
"
[
31
]
[
32
]
The
AUF
girl mentioned is
Stine Renate Håheim
interviewed by CNN's
Richard Quest
on 23 July 2011.
[
33

Håheim again quoted her friend Helle Gannestad, who had tweeted this from home, watching events unfold on TV.
[
34
]
On 24 August 2012, 33-year-old Norwegian
Anders Behring Breivik
was found
guilty
by the
Oslo District Court
of having perpetrated by himself both
terrorist attacks
, the bombing of the prime minister's office and the shooting spree on
Utøya
island, and was convicted to
containment
, a special form of
prison sentence
that can be extended indefinitely—with a time frame of 21 years and a minimum time of 10 years, which, in all, is the maximum penalty in Norway.
[
35
]
On 3 September 2012, Norwegian daily
Klassekampen
wrote that the
Gjørv Report
on the terrorist attack "is the hardest verdict against a Norwegian cabinet since the Fact-Finding Commission of 1945 ensured that
Johan Nygaardsvold
's political career was abruptly halted."
[
36

Stoltenberg said after the report was published that he had "ultimate responsibility for the preparedness in our country, a responsibility I take seriously," but said he would not resign.

Main article:
2013 Norwegian parliamentary election
Stoltenberg was the prime minister candidate for the Red-Green Coalition in the
2013 elections
, seeking re-election for a third term.
On 9 September 2013, the coalition failed to win a majority, with 72 of the required 85 mandates, despite the Labour Party remaining the largest party in Norway with 31%. After
Erna Solberg
formed
her cabinet
, Stoltenberg returned to the Parliament as leader of the opposition, and a member of the
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence
. In December 2013, he was appointed by the
United Nations
as a
Special Envoy on Climate Change
, alongside the former Ghanaian president
John Kufuor
.

When he became prime minister in 2000, he was portrayed as the "Norwegian

While Stoltenberg was prime minister, Norway's defence spending increased steadily, with the result that Norway today is one of the NATO allies with the highest per capita defence expenditure.
[
44
]
Stoltenberg has also been instrumental in modernising the Norwegian armed forces, and in contributing forces to various NATO operations.
[
45
]
Stoltenberg is a supporter of enhanced trans-Atlantic cooperation ties. He has also always been a supporter of Norwegian membership in the
European Union
.
[
46
]
Stoltenberg has criticized Israel over
alleged
violations of international law in the Palestinian Territories as well as in international waters, such as the
2010 Gaza flotilla raid
.
[
47

In 2006, Stoltenberg stated that "Norway condemns Israel's actions against Palestinians. Such collective punishment is totally unacceptable."
[
48

Stoltenberg praised doctors
Mads Gilbert
and
Erik Fosse
for their humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip during the
Gaza War
, stating that "all of Norway" was behind them.
[

]
Financial crisis
[
edit
]
Stoltenberg took an international role during the financial crisis by promoting international financial cooperation. This was among other arenas done through the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and a meeting in Chile 27–29 March 2009 where social democratic leaders from around the world met at a Progressive Governance Conference, just prior to the first G20 summit on the financial crisis. President
Bill Clinton
was among the delegates and panel that would chart a way out of the financial crisis, which included the host
Michelle Bachelet
, Britain's prime minister
Gordon Brown
, Brazil's President

Lula da Silva
and Stoltenberg. A special emergency meeting of the European Social Democratic Forum (PES) was gathered in Oslo in May 2011, on an initiative from Stoltenberg and the think tank Policy Network.
Both nationally and internationally, Stoltenberg emphasised the enormous costs the financial crisis had in the form of a high unemployment rate, and appealed for better international coordination, the balance between austerity and economic growth stimulus, active labor market measures for young people, and investments for increased innovation.

Norway came out of the financial crisis with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe.

Environment and climate change
[
edit
]
Partnering with tropical countries to preserve more of their rainforest to bind carbon dioxide (CO
2
) in order to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions
was a policy of the Stoltenberg government. In 2007, the government received support from the opposition to a long-term agreement to finance forest conservation with 3 billion NOK annually.
[
51
]
Stoltenberg through his governing advocated that international agreements with global taxes or quotas are the most effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the
UN Climate Change Conference 2009
, a separate proposal on the preservation of rainforests with funding from rich countries, advanced by Stoltenberg and Brazilian
Pres
.
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
in 2009 obtained support from among others U.S. President
Barack Obama
during COP15 in Copenhagen.

The summit in Copenhagen ended without a binding agreement, but before the subsequent COP16 in
Cancún
, Stoltenberg succeeded then-British Prime Minister
Gordon Brown
in the leadership of the committee dealing with the financing of climate actions in developing countries, also consisting of Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi
. Under a separate forest and climate conference in Oslo in May 2010, a proposal was presented to a number of countries, with final delivery of the report in autumn 2010.
In January 2014 Jens Stoltenberg became
United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Change
. During the meeting there he met with Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon
as well as
UN Framework Convention
director
Christiana Figueres
and both
Achim Steiner
and
Helen Clark
of the
United Nations Development Programme
.

Vaccines
[
edit
]
Stoltenberg has been an advocate for having all the world's children vaccinated against infectious diseases. The first speech he gave in his second term as prime minister

was during Norway's "Pharmaceutics days" in 2005 under the title "Vaccination against poverty". Stoltenberg was a board director of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (
GAVI
) from 2002 to 2005
[
53
]
and was awarded the Children's Health Award in 2005.
An international initiative, with the UK, the
Gates Foundation
and Norway in the lead, that GAVI received more than $3.7 billion until 2015 for their work against child mortality.
[
54
]
Stoltenberg was one of the key driving forces behind the initiative, and has stressed that this is an important contribution to save 9 million children from dying of the most common childhood illnesses.
In his New Year speech on 1 January 2013, Stoltenberg spoke about vaccination of the world's children as a personal matter of the heart. "Small jabs are giving millions of children the gift of life. Simple medicines can save their mothers. The fact that all these mothers' and children's lives can be saved is—as I see it—a miracle of our time," Stoltenberg said in his speech.

On the contrary, Russia's build-up continues." He said "we have made written proposals to the Putin administration to reduce risks and increase transparency of military activities, address space and cyber threats, and engage on arms control, including on nuclear weapons and missiles... [Putin] is attempting to roll back history. And recreate [the] spheres of influence. [He] wants to limit NATO's right to collective defence... and demands that we should remove all our forces and infrastructure from the countries that joined NATO after the fall of the Berlin Wall... wants to deny sovereign countries the right to choose their own path. And their own security arrangements. For Ukraine – but also for other countries, such as Finland and Sweden. And for the first time, we now see Beijing joining Moscow in calling on NATO to stop admitting new members. It is an attempt to control the fate of free nations.

What could have been done differently, what should have been done, to prevent Russia from going to war against Ukraine?
He answered that he regrets that NATO allies and NATO itself did not do more to strengthen Ukraine before Russia's invasion of Ukraine began. Potentially, the threshold for Russia to attack would have been higher if Ukraine had been militarily stronger. The USA, Canada and the UK trained Ukrainian soldiers in a training center in Ukraine, but NATO did not. NATO could have given much more training and equipment.

His nomination was controversial prior to being

. Stoltenberg resigned from his position as chairman of the MSC, but he still plans to return to the MSC after his tenure as minister.
[
178
]
[

179
]
Much like his position in the MSC, Stoltenberg also stepped down as head of the steering committee to focus entirely on his responsibilities as finance minister.
[
180
]
Tenure
[
edit
]
A week into his tenure, Stoltenberg was a part of the Norwegian delegation at the
61st Munich Security Conference
. He warned the
United States
against not allowing Ukraine to be a part of negotiations over a peace treaty with Russia over the
war in Ukraine
.
[
181
]
Stoltenberg launched an initiative to seek a compromise solution on tax settlement in March, which most of the opposition turned down with the exception of the
Greens
and the
Red Party
. Despite this setback, he expressed continued optimism about the proposal and cited the heightened global situation and the necessity to seek advise on how to change the tax system.
[
182
]
Stoltenberg accompanied prime minister
Jonas Gahr Støre
during his visit to
Washington, D.C.
in April to meet
US President
Donald Trump
to discuss US–Norway relations,
the war in Ukraine
and Norway's role in the
Arctic
.
[
183
]
[
184
]
During the summer of 2025, he came under fire for the
Government Pension Fund of Norway
investing in Israeli companies that contributed in the
killing of civilians in Gaza
. Stoltenberg argued that the fund's own Council on Ethics should evaluate whether or not they should sell themselves out of such companies.
[
185
]
[
186
]
The fund eventually sold itself out of eleven companies out of sixty-one they had invested in, a move Stoltenberg supported.
[
187
]
Stoltenberg was asked on several occasions by the
Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs
about his handling of the issue, but were unsatisfied with his responses. This came to a head following his response after the
2025 parliamentary election
, with members expressing that the committee should open a case against him, but this would ultimately be decided by the new members of the committee once parliament has been constituted for the next parliamentary term.
[
188
]
[
189
]
[
190
]
He presented the government's budget for 2026 on 15 October. The budget notably detailed that young people would receive 500 million NOK in tax lottery, the price of electric vehicles would increase, Norway Price (
Norgespris
) would be retained and likewise the

price for kindergarten slots, a lower tax on income and a change in the wealth tax. The proposed budget received criticism from both supporting and opposition parties, with the former highlighting lack of action for combatting inequality, green industry and environmental action and centralisation. The latter criticised it both for not prioritising crime and taxes and cutting in parental allowance.
[
191
]
After several revelations determined that the government had misled voters during the 2025 election campaign and contradicted their own budget proposals, Stoltenberg was confronted with his lack of presence to tackle the issue after going on a book tour. He emphasised that the book tour had been scheduled long before the budget controversy had arisen and further expressed that it was unfortunate that issues his party had campaigned on had been removed from the budget and that it was important to rectify their mistakes.

Incognito taxi driver in Norway
[
edit
]
In August 2013, Stoltenberg said on his Facebook page that he had spent an afternoon working
incognito
as a taxi driver in Oslo.
[
211
]
Stoltenberg said he had wanted to "hear from real Norwegian voters" and that "taxis were one of the few places

where people shared their true views." He added that, before driving the taxi, he had not driven a car in eight years.
[
211
]
The event was videotaped in a
hidden camera
fashion, and released as a promotional video by the Labour party for the election campaign.
[
212
]
It was later confirmed that 5 of the 14 customers were paid and recruited by the production company that produced the event for the Labour Party;
[
213
]
[
214
]
however, none knew that they would meet Stoltenberg.
[
215
]
[
216
]
BBC Radio 4 –
Desert Island Discs
[
edit
]
On 12 July 2020 Stoltenberg was the invited guest on the long running
BBC Radio 4
programme
Desert Island Discs
.
His musical choices included "
Hungry Heart
", sung by
Bruce Springsteen
; "
So Long, Marianne
", by
Leonard Cohen
; and "No Harm", by the duo
Smerz
, one of whom is his daughter Catharina.
[

In other media
[

In the crime drama
22 July
, which depicts the
2011 Norway attacks
, he is played by actor Ola G. Furuseth.
Controversies
[
edit
]
As a youth, Stoltenberg participated in protest rallies against the
U.S. war in Vietnam
in the 1970s.
[
218
]
In 2011, Stoltenberg said:
"We sang the chorus, 'Singing Norway, Norway out of Nato.' It was a hit."
[
218
]
In 2001, Stoltenberg crashed his Labour Party (Ap) owned car into a parked car; he then left the premises without leaving a note with his name or number; the damages cost 8,000
Norwegian kroner
to repair.
[
219
]
In 2002, Stoltenberg admitted to having used
hashish
(
cannabis
) in his youth.
[
220
]
He therefore asked the
Ministry of Justice and Public Security
to evaluate his impartiality in the upcoming government response to the report on drugs by the Stoltenberg Commission, headed by his father,
Thorvald Stoltenberg
.
[
221
]
In 2011 Stoltenberg received a 380,000 kroner boat as a birthday gift from the
Norwegian Labour Party (Ap)
and the
Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO)
; the Ap & LO also paid the tax for the gift, which led to criticism.
[
222
]
[
223
]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Stoltenberg is married to diplomat
Ingrid Schulerud
and they have two children:

a son, Axel Stoltenberg (born 1989) who is studying Chinese at the
Shanghai Jiaotong University
[
224
]
[
225
]
and daughter Anne Catharina Stoltenberg (born 1992) who is a part of
Smerz
, an
experimental pop
and
electronic music
duo signed to
XL Recordings
.
[
1
]
[
226
]
[
227
]
He has one living sister,
Camilla
, a medical researcher and administrator who is one year older than he; and one late sister,
Nini
, four years younger, who died in 2014. Nini was a recovering heroin
addict
, and the Norwegian media have covered the family's efforts to cope with this challenge.
[
228
]
He prefers to spend his summer vacations at his family's cottage on the
Hvaler
Islands in the
Oslofjord
.
[
229
]
An avid outdoorsman, he rides his bike often and during the winter season he is an active cross-country skier.
[
230
]
In December 2011, in order to mark 100 years since
Roald Amundsen
reached the south pole on skis, Stoltenberg journeyed to
Antarctica
.
[
231
]
He suffers from
ankylosing spondylitis
.
[
232
]
Stoltenberg is also a keen
video gamer
specifically strategy genre games.
[
233
]
Although being portrayed as an
atheist
for most of his adult life, and declining membership in the formerly official
Church of Norway
,
[
234
]
Stoltenberg has stated that he does not consider himself an atheist. He explained: "Although I am not a member of any denomination, I do believe that there is something greater than man. Some call it God, others call it something else. For me, it's about understanding that we humans are small in relation to nature, in relation to the powers that are bigger and stronger than man can ever comprehend. I find that in a church."
