Personal life
[
edit
]
Primakov was born in
Kyiv
in the
Ukrainian SSR
, and grew up in
Tbilisi
in the
Georgian SSR
.
Primakov's father's surname was Nemchenko. He had been imprisoned in the
Gulag
during the
Stalinist purges
.

Primakov's mother was Jewish, named Anna Yakovlevna Primakova. She worked as an
obstetrician
and was a cousin of the famous physiologist
Yakov Kirshenblat

Primakov was educated at the
Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies
, graduating in 1953, and carried out postgraduate work at
Moscow State University
. He graduated with a degree in Arabic.
[
9
]
His grandson is
Yevgeny Primakov Jr.
(
Russian
:
Евгений Александрович Примаков
), a journalist, TV host, politician and diplomat.
Early career
[
edit
]
From 1956 to 1970, he worked as a journalist for
Soviet radio
and a Middle Eastern correspondent for
Pravda
newspaper. During this time, he was sent frequently on intelligence missions to the Middle East and the United States as a
KGB
co-optee under codename MAKSIM.
[
10
]
[
11
]
Primakov reportedly may have been coerced into joining the intelligence services.
[
12
]
As a Senior Researcher at the
Institute of World Economy and International Relations
, Primakov entered into scientific society in 1962. From 30 December 1970 to 1977, he served as deputy director of the
Institute of World Economy and International Relations
, part  of the
Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union
. In this role he participated in the
Dartmouth Conferences
alongside, among others,
Charles Yost
. From 1977 to 1985 he was

Director of the
Institute of Oriental Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences
. During this time he was also First Deputy Chairman of the
Soviet Peace Committee
. In 1985 he returned to the
Institute of World Economy and International Relations
, serving as Director until 1989.
[
13
]
Primakov became involved in national politics in 1989, as the
Chairman of the Soviet of the Union
, one of two chambers of the Soviet parliament.
[
14
]
From 1990 until 1991 he was a member of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev
's
Presidential Council of the Soviet Union
.
[
13
]
He served as Gorbachev's special envoy to
Iraq
in the run-up to the
Persian Gulf War
, in which capacity he held talks with President
Saddam Hussein
to try to convince him to withdraw Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

Foreign intelligence chief (1991–1996)
[
edit
]
In 1992, Director of Foreign Intelligence Service Yevgeny Primakov admitted that the
KGB
was behind the Soviet newspaper articles claiming that
AIDS
was created by the US government.
[
18
]
After the
failed August 1991 putsch
, Primakov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the
KGB
and Director of the KGB
First Chief Directorate
responsible for foreign intelligence.
After the formation of the
Russian Federation
, Primakov shepherded the transition of the KGB First Chief Directorate to the control of the Russian Federation government, under the new name
Foreign Intelligence Service
(SVR). Primakov preserved the old KGB foreign intelligence apparatus under the new SVR label, and led no personnel purges or structural reforms.
[
19
]
He served as SVR director from 1991 until 1996.
[
13
]
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs (1996–1998)
[
edit
]
Primakov served as
Minister of Foreign Affairs
from January 1996 until September 1998. As foreign minister, he gained respect at home and abroad, with a reputation as a tough but pragmatic supporter of Russia's interests
[
20
]
and as an opponent of
NATO
's expansion into the former
Eastern Bloc
, though on 27 May 1997, after five months of negotiation with NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana
, Russia signed the
Founding Act
,
[
21
]
[
22
]
which is seen as marking the end of
Cold War
hostilities. He supported
Slobodan Milošević
during the
Yugoslav Wars
.
[
23
]

He was also famously an advocate of
multilateralism
as an alternative to American global hegemony following the
collapse of the Soviet Union
and the end of the Cold War. Primakov called for a Russian foreign policy based on low-cost mediation while expanding influence towards the Middle East and the former Soviet republics.
[
24
]
[
25
]
Called the "
Primakov doctrine
", beginning in 1999, he promoted Russia, India and China,
RIC
, origin of
BRICS
as a "strategic triangle" to counterbalance the United States
[
26
]
The move was interpreted by some observers as an agreement to fight together against '
colour revolutions
' in Central Asia.

Prime Minister of Russia (1998–1999)
[

Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet
After Yeltsin's bid to reinstate
Viktor Chernomyrdin
as
Prime Minister of Russia
was blocked by the
State Duma
in September 1998, the President turned to Primakov as a compromise figure whom he rightly judged would be accepted by the parliament's majority. As prime minister, Primakov was given credit for forcing some very difficult reforms in Russia; most of them, such as the
tax reform
, became major successes.
[
30
]
Following the 1998 harvest, which was the worst in 45 years, coupled with a plummeting ruble, one of Primakov's first actions as prime minister, in October 1998, was to appeal to the United States and Canada for food aid, while also appealing to the
European Union
for economic relief.
[
31
]
While Primakov's opposition to US
unilateralism
was popular among some Russians, it also led to a breach with the West during the 1999
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
, and isolated Russia during subsequent developments in the former Yugoslavia.
[
32
]
On 24 March 1999, Primakov was heading to Washington, D.C. for an official visit. Flying over the Atlantic Ocean, he learned that
NATO
had started to bomb Yugoslavia. Primakov decided to cancel the visit, ordered the plane to turn around over the ocean and returned to Moscow in a manoeuvre popularly dubbed "Primakov's Loop".
[
33
]
[
9
]
Yeltsin fired Primakov on 12 May 1999, ostensibly over the sluggish pace of the Russian economy. Many analysts believed the firing of Primakov reflected Yeltsin's fear of losing power to a more successful and popular person,
[
34
]
[
35
]
although

sources close to Yeltsin said at the time that the president viewed Primakov as being too close to the
Communist Party
.
[
36
]
Primakov himself would have had good chances as a candidate for the presidency. Primakov had refused to dismiss Communist ministers while the Communist Party was leading the process of preparing unsuccessful
impeachment
proceedings against the president.
[
37
]
Ultimately, Yeltsin resigned at the end of the year and was succeeded by his last prime minister,
Vladimir Putin
,
[
38
]
whom Primakov had tried to fire from his role as head of the
FSB
when he tapped the phone of the Duma President.
[
39
]
Primakov's dismissal was extremely unpopular with the Russian population: according to a poll, 81% of the population did not approve of the decision, and even among the liberal pro-Western party
Yabloko
supporters, 84% did not approve of the dismissal.
[
40
]
Post-PM career
[
edit
]
After 1988, Primakov held several roles: Academic Secretary of the World Economy and International Relations Division, director of the
Institute of World Economy and International Relations
and  member of the Presidium of the
Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union
.
Before Yeltsin's resignation, Primakov supported the
Fatherland – All Russia
electoral faction, which at that time was the major opponent of the pro-Putin
Unity
, and launched his presidential bid.
[
41
]
Initially considered the man to beat, Primakov was rapidly overtaken by the factions loyal to Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin
in the
December 1999 Duma elections
.
[
42
]
Primakov officially abandoned the presidential race in his TV address on 4 February 2000
[
43
]
less than two months before the
26 March presidential elections
. Soon he became an adviser to Putin and a political ally.
[
44
]
On 14 December 2001, Primakov became President of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a position he held until 2011.
[
45
]
Leader of
Fatherland – All Russia
Duma faction Yevgeny Primakov meets President
Vladimir Putin
, 2000
In February and March 2003, he visited Iraq and held talks with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein
, as a special representative of President Putin. He passed on a message from Putin calling for Hussein to resign voluntarily.
[
46
]
He tried to prevent the
2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
, a move which received

some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Hussein must hand over all
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
to the
United Nations
, among other things. However, Hussein told Primakov that he was confident that nothing would befall him personally
[
47
]
—a belief that was later
proven incorrect
. Primakov later claimed Hussein's execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on
Iraq–United States relations
that could embarrass the U.S. government.
[
48
]
In a 2006 speech Primakov thundered that: "The collapse of the US policies pursued in Iraq delivered a fatal blow on the American doctrine of unilateralism."
[
49
]
On 26 May 2008, Primakov was elected as a member of the Presidium of the
Russian Academy of Sciences
.
[
50
]
In 2009, the
University of Niš
,
Serbia
awarded Primakov an honorary doctorate.
[
51
]
In November 2004, Primakov testified in defense of the former
Yugoslav
President
Slobodan Milošević
, on trial for war crimes.
[
52
]
He had earlier led a Russian delegation that met with Milošević during the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
in March 1999.
[
53

Death
[
edit
]
Farewell to Yevgeny Primakov on 29 June 2015
Primakov died in
Moscow
on 26 June 2015, at the age of 85, after prolonged illness (liver cancer).
[
54
]
[
9
]
He was buried with military honours at
Novodevichy Cemetery
.
[
55
]
He was lionized in Russia obituaries as "the Russian Kissinger", and President
Vladimir Putin
said Primakov had made a "colossal contribution to the formation of modern Russia... This is a sad, grievous loss for our society. … Yevgeny's authority was respected both in our country and abroad..."
[
39
]
Indeed, "his death occurred at a time when his positions [were] very much the official line and the backbone for Putin's grand strategy."
[
56
]
In honor of Primakov,
Primakov Readings
was established in October 2015 - an annual international summit aimed at promoting dialogue on current global trends in the world economy, international politics and security among high-ranking experts, diplomats and decision-makers from around the Globe, organized by the
Institute of World Economy and International Relations
and held in
Moscow
.
[
57
]
One of his credos was: "Those who do good will be rewarded. Life gets even with those who

do bad."
