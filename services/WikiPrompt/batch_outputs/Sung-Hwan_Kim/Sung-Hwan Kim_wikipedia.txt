Early Life and education
[
edit
]
Kim was born in Geomundo-ri, Samsan-myeon, Yeosu County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea. He attended Seoul Changseo Elementary School, Jungdong Middle School, and Hansung High School. In 1990, he earned a Bachelor of Laws from Yonsei University. He later obtained a Master of Public Administration, with a concentration in urban and local governance, from Yonsei University's Graduate School of Public Administration in 1999. His graduate thesis focused on strategies for revitalizing senior centers.

Political career
[
edit
]
Kim began his political career as a legislative aide to National Assembly member Shin Kye-ryoon in the early 1990s. He was elected as a member of the Nowon District Council in 1995 and served in the Seoul Metropolitan Council from 1998 to 2002. During this period, he was also active in numerous civic organizations and policy forums, focusing on local governance and social justice.
In 2002, Kim served as a welfare policy advisor to then-presidential candidate Roh Moo-hyun. Following Roh’s election, Kim was appointed to the presidential transition team and subsequently served in the Blue House as an administrative officer and later as a secretary in the Office for Policy Coordination, serving from 2003 to 2007.
He ran unsuccessfully for the National Assembly in 2008 but won the mayoralty of Nowon District in the 2010 local elections, defeating the incumbent. He was re-elected in 2014 with an increased vote share and held the position until early 2018.

In 2018, Kim successfully ran for the National Assembly in a by-election for the Nowon District Byeong constituency, filling the vacancy left by Ahn Cheol-soo. Running under the Democratic Party banner, he defeated Lee Jun-seok of the Bareunmirae Party. Kim was re-elected in the 2020 general election and, in 2024, was elected to represent the Nowon District Eul constituency.

In the National Assembly, Kim has served on the Industry, Trade, SMEs and Startups Committee, the Energy Special Committee, the Climate Crisis Special Committee, and the National Assembly Steering and Political Affairs Committees. He has also held several key positions within the Democratic Party, including Chief of Staff to the Party Leader (2018–2020), Chief Deputy Floor Leader for Planning (2021–2022), Chair of the Policy Committee (2022–2023), and Secretary of the Talent Recruitment Committee

(from 2023). He currently serves as the head of the party's chapter for Nowon District Eul.

Kim is noted for his progressive stance on social welfare, environmental sustainability, and participatory governance. He has authored several books addressing political thought, social coexistence, and reflections on the legacy of former President Roh Moo-hyun. His publications include:

He Left, But I Did Not Let Him Go (2010)
Speaking About Roh Moo-hyun Through 10 Books (2010)
Butterfly Effect (2012)

Kim has participated in numerous elections at the district, city, and national levels since 1995, securing victories in local legislative bodies, mayoral posts, and national assembly races. Notably, he was elected Mayor of Nowon District in 2010 and 2014 and won seats in the National Assembly in 2018, 2020, and 2024.
