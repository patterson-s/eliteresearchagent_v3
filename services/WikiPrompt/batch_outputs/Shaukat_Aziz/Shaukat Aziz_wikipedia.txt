Shaukat Aziz had been a president of

Shortly, General Pervez Musharraf arrived for a small personal trip to

the United States after staging a
coup d'état
to deposed the people-elected prime minister
Navaz Sharif
on 12 October 1999.
[
11
]
On 26 November 1999, while addressing a gathering of influential lobbyists of the
Pakistani American community
, a political lobbying sub-body of the
Association of Pakistani Physicians of North America
(APPNA), Musharraf stated that: "Shaukat Aziz has come to Pakistan with forty other financial experts who have offered free service to revive Pakistan's national economy".
[
11
]
After a brief session, Musharraf asked Shaukat Aziz to stand up and introduce himself to the audience.
[
11
]
Aziz reportedly returned with Musharraf in November 1999 and took charge of the
Finance ministry
as its
Finance Minister
. Aziz took control of the economy with responsibility for
Finance
,
Economic Affairs
,
Statistics Division
,
Planning and Development
, and
Revenue divisions
. As Minister of Finance Aziz also headed the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, the Cabinet Committee on Investment, the executive committee of the National Economic Council, and the Cabinet Committee on Privatization. As Finance minister, all
state-owned mega-corporations
came under the government-ownership while restructuring each mega-corporation to set off to privatisation.
[
12
]
During his first days, Aziz worked to control the economy in a difficult and hostile environment with then-President
Muhammad Rafiq Tarar
who called him "an alien", and many among those who were close to deposed prime minister
Nawaz Sharif
and Benazir Bhutto.
[
13
]
Other politicians including
Fazal-ur-Rehman
and
Ameen Faheem
became hostile towards Aziz and his policies; and harboured grave doubts about him because Aziz was not like a traditional politician in the country, an accredited politician.
[
13
]
Initially there was a decline in the economy, and Aziz attributes this as "state (Pakistan) unpleasant relations with international financial institutions.
[
14
]
There was a ~70% decline in the national economy with the loss of $150 million (1999) to $600 million (2000), which constituted 0.21% of
foreign direct investment
(FDI) global flow.
[
14
]
Aziz took initiatives for FDI offering incentives to foreign investors with his
macroeconomic
policies, taxation framework and a consistent investment policy.

After the
11 September attacks
in the United States and
Pakistan's role
in the
war on terror
, Aziz travelled to the United States in order to

negotiate a relief and
U.S. aid to Pakistan
.
[
9
]
He closely worked with
US Secretary of the Treasury
on the detail of the devised plan on how to
remove the Taliban
from Afghanistan, cancellation and debt relief, loans from the World Bank, and direct support from U.S. Aid for national public development.
[
9
]
Aziz recommended policies and new plan of economic reforms, including the improved budgetary transparency and spending controls— a plan that was widely accepted by the United States.
[
9
]
With the help from
United States Department of the Treasury
, Aziz thwarted individuals, difficulties and obstacles to achieve success in his economic programmes.
[
9
]
In 2002, Aziz worked with U.S. administration to help advise the United States to finance the
war in Afghanistan
.
[
9
]
In the words of John B. Taylor, Aziz suggested that U.S. should call out for a meeting of finance ministers of the
G7 member
countries, where the illicit funding of money would become a great problem for G7 countries in the future.
[
9
]
In April 2002, Aziz chaired a
historical
meeting on behalf of Pakistan and the United States, helping the G7 members to understand how the illicit money was transferred was shared with the finance ministers of G7 members and Pakistan on other side.
[
9
]
In 2001, Aziz implemented and activated the
Privatisation Programme
(first founded by former prime minister
Nawaz Sharif
in 1991) and opened all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to private sector.
[
12
]
This programme undertook the country into rapid economic growth and extreme level of industrialisation the country had for yet seen since 1972.
[
12
]
After the
2002 general elections
, Aziz intensified his programme and aggressively implemented
economic liberalisation
policies in the country.
[
12
]
Aziz's financial policies came under surrounding controversies,
[
12
]
creating new problems for Prime minister
Zafarullah Khan Jamali
to counter who was forced to resign the office in his favour.
[
12
]
His affordable real estate scheme encouraged common men to afford a house and a vehicle on low investment. On the other hand, this scheme brought an increased violation of zoning regulations in construction companies. Although, Zafarullah Khan Jamali controlled the inflation at its low level, his deregulation policies of price control caused the oil and sugar prices to skyrocket.
[

12
]
His public and liberalisation of economy policy expanded the political role of
Supreme Court of Pakistan
in a higher level of the government and to target high-level of government corruption independently without government interferences.
[
12
]
Pakistan's fiscal performance was praised by
IMF
and the World Bank.
[
15
]
The World Bank further reiterated that Pakistan's economic growth bolstered international confidence.
[
16
]
Assassination attempt
[
edit
]
While campaigning on 30 July 2004, Aziz survived an assassination attempt in the
Attock District
of
Punjab, Pakistan
.
[
17
]
[
18
]
The suicide bomb attack was staged in
Fateh Jang
, a small town to the north of the capital, Islamabad, where Aziz was contesting an election.
[
17
]
The attempt was made when Aziz was departing after meeting with constituents. A suicide bomber, who was travelling with the Aziz motorcade, detonated the device next to the car in which Aziz was travelling, killing himself and Aziz's chauffeur, as well as six others.
[
17
]
[
19
]
[
20
]
Aziz called the incident "tragic", and said it had claimed the lives of innocent people. He added that it had reinforced his resolve to serve Pakistan and the Islamic world.
[
21
]
After safely reaching Islamabad, Aziz instigated a probe, while the foreign office contacted its mission in Egypt to try to determine the veracity of an Al Qaeda claim of responsibility.
[
22
]
Ten suspected
Al-Qaeda
perpetrators were arrested in Egypt and later extradited to Pakistan for the crime.
[
22
]
Premiership
[
edit
]
By 2004, Aziz had become a right hand of general Musharraf, as Musharraf described in
his memoirs
.
[
23
]
The strong oligarch business class of Pakistan, notably
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain
, had been impressed by Shaukat Aziz's performance as finance minister.
[
23
]
Following the resignation of
Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali
on 26 June 2004, Hussain nominated Aziz for the office of prime minister and was also a top choice for the candidacy of prime ministerial post by Musharraf.
[
23
]
[
24
]
However, Aziz was not a member of the
National Assembly
, although he was a
Senator
.
[
23
]
As required by the constitution, the prime minister had to be a member of the National Assembly.
[
23
]
Aziz was highly

regarded as a "technocrat" and had gained the trust of the establishment, international institutions and public support. His nomination came after another technocrat-economist, Dr.
Manmohan Singh
, became the
prime minister of India
and Aziz was widely seen as compatible with his Indian counterpart.

25
]

Having been described and labelled as an urban gentlemen and smartly dressed, Aziz was tasked with day-to-day running of the federal government and see that policies were more effectively executed while Musharraf handled the military issues.
[
24
]
In Pakistan, it was also said that Musharraf blindly trusted Aziz and sometimes, Musharraf's approvals were not needed for the projects that normally required permission.
[
24
]
Aziz quietly and more quickly undermined the elements seeking to undermine Musharraf which may have been a factor that Musharraf had blindly trusted Aziz.
[
24
]
The post was held by
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain
[
26
]
while Aziz fulfilled the constitutional requirement of securing a seat in the lower house of
parliament
. Aziz ran from two constituencies,
Tharparkar-I
in Sindh, and
Attock District
.
[
27
]
Even after the assassination attempt, Aziz continued campaigning and won from both constituencies. Since he could retain only one seat, he immediately vacated his
Tharparkar
seat, preferring to represent Attock, where he had won by 76,156 votes to 29,497.
Domestic reforms
[

]

water supply and sanitation filter
plants through the Khushal Pakistan (lit. Prospered Pakistan) programme, a scheme founded by
Nawaz Sharif
in the 1990s.
[
30
]
As prime minister, Aziz took hard stance against rivals and took a hardline against his political challengers.
[
31
]
Aziz thrashed the
Alliance for Restoration of Democracy
(ARD) led by conservative leader
Javed Hashmi
who was placed

in military prison on treason charges, on a support provided by Aziz.
[
31
]
His hardline and tough counter
active measures
forced
Pakistan Peoples Party
of
Benazir Bhutto
and
Pakistan Muslim League-N
of
Nawaz Sharif
to concede their defeat and took asylum in United Kingdom.
[
31
]
In 2005, non-partisan local government elections were decided to be held in entire country, starting first to hold the elections in Karachi,
Sindh Province
.
[
32
]
Subsequently, Aziz supervised and presided the first free and fair local body elections with PML(Q) and its allied parties sweeping the election arena.
[
33
]
Controversially, Aziz allocated Rs. 20 million to each district where PML(Q) candidates lost the National Assembly elections in order to secure its voting bank that was lost in 2002.
[
34
]
In Sindh and Balochistan Province, Aziz presided the peaceful election held events and personally monitored the success of the local government body programme.

Problems began to mount with nationalist
Akbar Bugti
, an ally of
Nawaz Sharif
.
[
37
]
Although, Aziz repeatedly and forcefully denied the knowledge of any military action against Bugti and, as prime minister, Aziz never released any information of any military action in Balochistan.
[
37
]
However, Aziz appeared on television screens and stated that "Akbar Bugti died in a military operation during the night of August 25–26, 2008".
[
37
]
Aziz was inflicted with the involvement in the killing of Akbar Khan Bugti, although he has denied any involvement in any manner.
[
38
]
In Islamabad alone, Aziz's government was forced to take military action, codename
Silence
after chairing a meeting with the President.
[
39
]
In 2009, Aziz maintained that his government had tried at every level of extreme to resolve the
Lal Masjid issue
through talks to save lives.
[
39
]
In a television interview, Aziz maintained that "We gave them time to leave the mosque and the
Imam-e-Kaaba Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais
also came to Pakistan on my request in connection with the issue.".
[
39
]
One of the widely reported controversy took place in his government was the atomic proliferation scandal

of Abdul Qadeer Khan. Aziz remains supportive towards Khan and efficiently took matters of Abdul Qadeer Khan in 2006 from President Musharraf. On 10 September 2006, Aziz sent flowers and personally visited Khan when he was hospitalised
[
40
]
and on 12 October 2007, Musharraf made it clear to United States and rest of the world that Khan "won't be handed over" at given any circumstances.
[
41
]
On a television speech, Aziz paid a huge tribute to Abdul Qadeer Khan and while commenting on last part of his speech, Aziz stressed it:
The (meritorious) services of scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan are "
unforgettable
" for our beloved country, "Pakistan" ...

[
61
]
Aziz strongly allied with the United States in the fight against terrorism, and in a meeting with an American journalist, Aziz maintained that: "Pakistan is now ideally positioned to "work with cooperation rather than confrontation as a force for peace, stability, and prosperity."
[
62
]
During his tenure, relations with the United States strengthened and progressed.
[
63
]
In 2006, Aziz quoted: "Pakistan-American relations are based on mutual trust and respect and are long-standing."
[
63
]
During his repeated visits to the United States, Aziz worked and deliberately approached the U.S. administration on building a strategic partnership with the United States, and made efforts to build a "robust-broad-based strategic relationship"..
[
64
]
Aziz's economic, domestic, and internal reforms focused on enriching a longer-term sustainable Pakistan-U.S. relationship and contributed immeasurably to both countries' joint struggle against extremism.
[
64
]
Relations
with Israel were considered important by Aziz's government, and supported Musharraf's policy on Israel.
[
65
]
At foreign fronts, Aziz maintained a "
Telephone Policy
"
[
66
]
on diplomatic engagement with Israel, whilst keeping Saudi Arabia and Turkey in tacit contact.
[
66
]
[
67
]
During his tenure,
bilateral relations
with the United Kingdom were enhanced and reached to a new level after meeting with British prime minister
Tony Blair
in 2005, and tightened the economic and defence relations with British counterpart Gordon Brown in 2007.
[
68
]
Brown thanked Aziz for the successful launching of a $500 million
Eurobond
, which was oversubscribed four times.
[
69
]
After assuming the office of prime minister, Aziz left for China, as his foreign state visit as prime minister in 2004.
[
70
]
In 2007, Aziz made his final state visit as prime minister

to China to sign a
Free Trade Agreement
[
71
]
with China, and regarded the country as a "strategic partner"
[
72
]
and a "time-tested friend",
[
72
]
whilst China regarded the FTA agreement as "a historic development".
[
72
]
Aziz built closer economic ties with India while alleviating the
territorial conflicts
. After meeting with Indian counterpart
Manmohan Singh
, a confident measuring building process was initiated by Aziz.
[
73
]
Aziz pushed his foreign policy to Russia,
[
74
]
calling Russia a "global super power".
[
75
]
In 2006, Aziz invited state-run and private-media of Russia where he repeatedly stressed for the need to enhance cooperation between Pakistan and Russia in the fields of education, science and technology, energy, defence and trade and investment.
[
74
]
Finally, in 2007, Russian prime minister
Mikhail Fradkov
paid a three-day-long visit to Pakistan, becoming the first Russian prime minister and leader to visit the country in 38 years.
[
76
]
During this trip, Aziz and Fradkov pledged to boost economic ties and signed two co-operation agreements .
[
77

Economic policy
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Privatization, Third Phase
and
Economic liberalisation in Pakistan
Pakistan's GDP growth rate from the period of nationalisation in the 1970s until the economic boom in 2004–08
During his tenure, Aziz aggressively promoted the privatisation, deregulation and economic liberalisation programme and open the large heavy mechanical industries, petroleum companies, electropetroleum and chemical enterprises and state-owned corporations to private sectors.
[
78
]
His tenure as finance minister and prime minister, the agriculture production and construction well increased, whilst aggressively and forcefully implementing his policies to liberalise the trade, and eliminated the non-tariff barriers.
[
78
]
Under his regime, the maximum bound tariffs were brought down to high as 300% to 25% whilst the applied tariff averages falls in the range of 5% to 10%.
[
78
]
The poverty alleviation programme performances indicates Aziz's successful implementation of his policies.
GDP growth, which was at 3.9% in October 1999, stood between 6.6% and 9%. He successfully privatised all state-owned corporations and state enterprises before completing his term.
[
79
]
However, Aziz's strategy failed deal with underlying problems deeply in country's economy.
[
79
]
The
Great Recession
led to a sharp drop in the country's economy while an acute electricity shortage in the country revealed

the incompetence by the Peoples Party's government, but also the failure of his government to develop the necessary energy infrastructure on time.
[
79
]
Political economists, however, gave other side of story by arguing that his policies were not aimed at alleviating poverty as he seldom offered relief to the poor sections of the society. Shaukat Aziz is roundly criticized for his policy of downsizing in the
public sector
and disintegrating the effects of nationalisation policies of
Benazir Bhutto
as early as the 1990s but Aziz defended as he points out that his policies made these institutions viable while they were on the verge of collapse.
S. Akbar Zaidi
argues that his policies mastered Pakistan's economy but such indicators are misleading and unsustainable because his policies do not examine or explain the particular, perplexing economy of Pakistan.
[
80
]
Privitization
[
edit
]
An unsuccessful attempt to privatise the
Pakistan Steel Mills
was also thwarted by trade unions and pro-nationalization elements who took the case to
Supreme Court of Pakistan
in 2006. But Aziz said that his privatisation program produced "the second fastest growing economy in the world."
[
81
]
Public image
[
edit
]
A banker and financier by training and extensive experience in the United States, Aziz's credentials are extremely high and considered one of the successful finance minister of Pakistan.
[
23
]
His credential records are similar to those of the successful US treasury secretaries such as
Bob Rubin
and
Nicholas F. Brady
who did well under Clinton and Reagan administrations.
[
64
]
He understands the role of banking, finance, investment and consumer credit in economic growth of a nation.
[
64
]
Aziz presided the strong banking sector, unprecedented investment and growth finance sectors in Pakistan to underpin its economy.
[
64
]
He strengthened capital availability, an essential and increasingly important economic input, in addition to labour and land improvements.
[
64
]
With higher education budget up 15-fold and overall education spending up 36% in two years, he focused on education to improve the availability of skilled labour to fill new jobs.
[
64
]
As Prime minister and as well as finance minister, Aziz did extraordinarily well ... statistics on Pakistan's economic growth has now grown at 8.4%— the second fastest growing economy in the world after China
— Richard Haas, 2006
Aziz aggressively pushed land development and

public and private construction spending to improve infrastructure and facilities to attract greater business investment.
[
64
]
The international communities regarded Aziz as a reformer, with Pakistan's structural reforms ranking high amongst emerging economies.
[
64
]
Aziz co-chaired the Secretary-General's High Level Panel on the United Nations System-wide Coherence in the areas of development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. Aziz oversaw the success of the privatisation programme in Pakistan and most of the proceeds so far have come from the telecom and banking sectors, around 80% of Pakistan's banking sector was put under the private hands.
[
81
]
Nothing is sacred, we are packaging up our companies
— Prime minister Shaukat Aziz, 2006
The BBC noted that the privatisation programme, initiated by Nawaz Sharif in 1990, picked up from a jog to a sprint under watchful eyes of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. The prime minister is considered the chief architect of privatisation and is widely respected among foreign investors.
[
81
]
In an interview with BBC, Aziz mentioned Pakistan's economic growth as he puts it:
Pakistan has had the most broad-based structural reform of any country in Asia. Last year, we were the second fastest growing economy in the world after China. We grew at 8.4%....
— Shaukat Aziz, 2006,
[
81
]
In 2008, Aziz participated in the Global Creative Leadership Summit, organised by the
Louise Blouin
Foundation. As a delegate, he delivered a keynote speech for the panel entitled "Economic Crisis, Economics of Change: Credit, Commodities, and Trade."
Post-premiership
[
edit
]
Shaukat Aziz currently resides in West London, United Kingdom. He serves on a number of boards and advisory boards including
Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc
.
[
82
]
and
The Blackstone Group
.
[
83
]
According to Aziz, he has maintained good relations with several members of his government and the members of the
Parliament
including his former foreign minister
Khurshid Kasuri
and the former railways minister
Sheikh Rasheed
and his party president
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain
.
[
39
]
In the midst of 2009, the polls performed by various news agencies, Aziz's approval rating ranged from 30.7%,
[
84
]
but ratings dramatically fell down to 17.3%
[
84
]
in the end of 2009.
[
84
]
In 2012, in polls managed by various news surveys, Aziz's popularity approval ratings ranged at 20.5%.
[
84
]
Aziz remained

active in political arena of the country and has vigorously defended his financial policies. Aziz criticised the care-taker government of
Muhammad Mian Soomro
for the economic collapse, and predicted that, "the
next elections
will sweep, paving the way for a two-party system to emerge with the
Pakistan Muslim League
in the government and the
Peoples Party
in the opposition".
[
85
]
He remains active on economic issues and harshly criticised the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for failing to show leadership during the
2008 financial crisis
.
[
86
]
While attending the international business conference at Philippines, Aziz maintained that: "This global institution (IMF) which is supposed to look at everything going on was not even in the room where meetings are going on".
[
86
]
Legal case
[
edit
]
On 30 October 2011, Aziz directed a letter sent from Dubai to the Provincial Police Office to
Balochistan
High Court stating "he had been mentioned in the FIR registered at the Dera Bugti Police Station on 13 October 2009, which alleged that then president Pervez Musharraf used him as part of Akbar Bugti case in which the latter committed suicide during a military operation.".
[
37
]
Aziz maintained that he was informed of "unfortunate event" through the televised media.
[
37
]
Aziz later stated in television that Akbar Bugti died in a military operation during the night of 25/26 August 2008.
[
37
]
Wealth
[
edit
]
On 5 November 2017, Aziz appeared on the
Paradise Papers
leaks.
[
87
]
The leaks claimed that he was linked with the Antarctic Trust, which was set up by Aziz himself. This trust was neither declared by him as
prime minister
nor as
finance minister
.
[
88
]
Aziz, a former Citibank executive, told the
ICIJ
he had set the trust up for
estate planning
purposes and that the funds had come from his employment at Citibank. An internal Appleby document raised concerns about warrants issued for him in connection with the killing of a local leader. Aziz dismissed both the murder charge and the allegations of financial impropriety.
