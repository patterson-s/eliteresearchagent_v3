Rania at the
World Economic Forum
on the Middle East held at the
Dead Sea, Jordan
, in 2007
Queen Rania's first venture was the establishment of the
Jordan River Foundation
(JRF) in 1995.
[
17
]
The Jordan River Children Program (JRCP) was developed by Rania to place children's welfare above political agendas and cultural taboos.
[
18
]
This led to the launch, in 1998, of JRF's Child Safety Program, which addresses the immediate needs of children at risk from abuse and initiated a long-term campaign to increase public awareness about violence against children. The deaths of two children in Amman as a result of child abuse in early 2009 led Rania to call for an emergency meeting of government and non-government (including JRF) stakeholders to discuss where the system was failing.
[
19
]
In 2009, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of her husband's accession to the throne, Rania launched a community champion award (

[
25

Aslında dedem Türk'tür. Annemin babası. Bu nedenle Türk müziği dinleyerek büyüdüm. Türk yemekleriyle yetiştim. Bunların hepsi benim geçmişimin bir parçası. Çocukluğumdan beri Türk kültürünün tüm unsurlarıyla iç içe büyüdüm.
[Actually my grandfather was Turkish. My mother's father. That's why I grew up listening to Turkish music. I grew up with Turkish food. This is all part of my past. Since my childhood, I grew up with all the elements of Turkish culture.]
