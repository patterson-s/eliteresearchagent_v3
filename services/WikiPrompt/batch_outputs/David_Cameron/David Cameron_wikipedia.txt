David William Donald Cameron, Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton
(born 9 October 1966), is a British politician who served as
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
from 2010 to 2016. Until 2015, he led the first coalition government in the UK since 1945 and resigned after
a referendum
supported the country's
leaving
the
European Union
. After
his premiership
, he served as
Foreign Secretary
in the government of prime minister
Rishi Sunak
from 2023 to 2024. Cameron was
Leader of the Conservative Party
from 2005 to 2016 and served as
Leader of the Opposition
from 2005 to 2010. He was
Member of Parliament
(MP) for
Witney
from 2001 to 2016, and has been a member of the
House of Lords
since November 2023. Cameron identifies as a
one-nation conservative
and has been associated with both
economically liberal
and
socially liberal
policies.
Born in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at
Eton College
and
Brasenose College, Oxford
. After becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition
Shadow Cabinet
under Conservative leader
Michael Howard
, and
succeeded Howard in 2005
. Following the
2010 general election
,
negotiations led to Cameron becoming prime minister
as the head of
a coalition government
with the
Liberal Democrats
.
His premiership
was marked by the effects of the
2008 financial crisis
and the
Great Recession
, which his government sought to address through
austerity measures
. His administration passed the
Health and Social Care Act
and the

Welfare Reform Act
, which introduced large-scale changes to
healthcare
and
welfare
. It also attempted to enforce stricter immigration policies via the
Home Office hostile environment policy
, introduced
reforms to education
, and oversaw the
2012 London Olympics
. Cameron's administration privatised
Royal Mail
and some other state assets, implemented the
Equality Act
, and legalised
same-sex marriage in England and Wales
. Internationally, Cameron oversaw
Operation Ellamy
in the
First Libyan Civil War
and authorised the bombing of the
Islamic State
in Syria. Constitutionally, his government oversaw the
2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum
and
Scottish independence referendum
, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the
2015 general election
, he remained as prime minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government known as the
Second Cameron ministry
. Cameron introduced the
Brexit referendum
on the
UK's continuing membership of the European Union
in 2016. He supported the
Britain Stronger in Europe
campaign which lost. Following the success of
Vote Leave
, Cameron resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by
Theresa May
, his home secretary.
Cameron resigned his seat on 12 September 2016, and maintained a low political profile. He has served as the president of
Alzheimer's Research UK
from 2017 to 2023, and returned in 2025; and was implicated in the
Greensill scandal
. Cameron released his memoir,
For the Record
, in 2019. In 2023 he was appointed foreign secretary by
Rishi Sunak
and became a
life peer
as Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton. After the Conservatives lost the
2024 general election
to the
Labour Party
, Cameron retired as foreign secretary. However, he maintains his
House of Lords
seat.
Cameron was credited for helping to modernise the Conservative Party, and for reducing the UK's national deficit. However, he was subject to criticism for austerity measures, as well as his decision to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, which led to political instability in the UK during the late
2010s
.

Early family life
Further information:
Family of David Cameron
David William Donald Cameron was born on 9 October 1966 at the
London Clinic
in
Marylebone

, London,
[
4
]
and raised at
Peasemore
in Berkshire.
[
5
]
He has two sisters and an elder brother,
Alexander Cameron
.
[
6
]
Cameron is the younger son of Ian Donald Cameron, a stockbroker, and his wife Mary Fleur, a retired
Justice of the Peace
and the daughter of
Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet
.
[
7
]
He is also a descendant of
William IV
through one of the king's
illegitimate children
.
[
4
]
Cameron's father was born at
Blairmore House
near
Huntly
, Aberdeenshire, and died near
Toulon
, France, on 8 September 2010;
[
8
]
Blairmore was built by Cameron's great-great-grandfather, Alexander Geddes,
[
9
]
[
10
]
who had made a fortune in the
grain trade
in Chicago, United States, before returning to Scotland in the 1880s.
[
11
]
Blairmore was sold soon after Ian's birth.
[
10
]
Cameron has said: "On my mother's side of the family, her mother was a Llewellyn, so
Welsh
. I'm a real mixture of
Scottish
, Welsh and English."
[
12
]
He has also referenced the
German Jewish
ancestry of one of his great-grandfathers, Arthur Levita, a descendant of the
Yiddish
author
Elia Levita
.
[
13
]
[
14
]
Education
Cameron was educated at two
private schools
. From the age of seven, he was taught at
Heatherdown School
in
Winkfield
,
Berkshire
. Owing to good grades, he entered its top academic class almost two years early.
[
15
]
At the age of 13, he went on to
Eton College
in Berkshire, following his father and elder brother.
[
16
]
His early interest was in art. Six weeks before taking his
O-levels
, he was caught smoking
cannabis
.
[
17
]
He admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, so he was not expelled; instead he was fined, prevented from leaving the school grounds and given a "
Georgic
" (a punishment that involved copying 500 lines of
Latin
text).
[
18
]
Cameron passed twelve O-levels and then three
A levels
:
History of Art
; History, in which he was taught by
Michael Kidson
; and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the
scholarship level
exam in Economics and Politics.
[
19
]
The following autumn, he passed

the entrance exam for the
University of Oxford
, and was offered an
exhibition
at
Brasenose College
.
[
20
]
Brasenose College, Oxford
After leaving Eton in 1984
[
21
]
Cameron started a nine-month
gap year
. For three months, he worked as a researcher for his godfather
Tim Rathbone
, then Conservative MP for
Lewes
, during which time he attended debates in the
House of Commons
.
[
22
]
Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in Hong Kong by
Jardine Matheson
as a 'ship jumper', an administrative post.
[
23
]
Returning from Hong Kong, Cameron visited the then-
Soviet Union
, where he was approached by two Russian men speaking fluent English. He was later told by one of his professors that it was "definitely an attempt" by the
KGB
to recruit him.
[
24
]
In October 1985 Cameron began his Bachelor of Arts course in
Philosophy, Politics and Economics
(PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford.
[
25
]
His tutor,
Vernon Bogdanor
, has described him as "one of the ablest" students he has taught,
[
26
]
with "moderate and sensible Conservative"
political views
.
[
6
]
Guy Spier
, who shared tutorials with Cameron, remembers him as an outstanding student: "We were doing our best to grasp basic economic concepts. David—there was nobody else who came even close. He would be integrating them with the way the British political system is put together. He could have lectured me on it, and I would have sat there and taken notes."
[
27
]
When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a "Bill of Rights" to replace the
Human Rights Act
, however, Bogdanor, himself a
Liberal Democrat
, said: "I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding".
[
28
]
While at Oxford, Cameron was a member of the
Bullingdon Club
, an exclusive all-male dining society with a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.
[
29
]
In his 2019 memoir
For the Record
, Cameron wrote about being a member of the Bullingdon and its impact on his political career, saying: "When I look now

at the
much-reproduced photograph
taken of our group of appallingly over-self-confident 'sons of privilege', I cringe. If I had known at the time the grief I would get for that picture, of course I would never have joined. But life isn't like that..." and: "These were also the years after the ITV adaptation of
Brideshead Revisited
when quite a few of us were carried away by the fantasy of an
Evelyn Waugh
-like Oxford existence."
[
30
]
Cameron's period in the Bullingdon Club was examined in a 2009
Channel 4
docudrama,
When Boris Met Dave
, the title referring to
Boris Johnson
, another high-profile Conservative Party figure, the then-mayor of London, who had been a member at the same time, and who would go on to be prime minister himself.
Cameron graduated in 1988 with a
first-class
BA degree (later promoted to an
MA
by seniority).
[
31
]
Early political career
Conservative Research Department
After graduation, Cameron worked for the
Conservative Research Department
between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including
Edward Llewellyn
,
Ed Vaizey
and
Rachel Whetstone
. They and others formed a group they called the "
Smith Square
set", which was dubbed the "Brat Pack" by the press, though it is better known as the "
Notting Hill set
", a name given to it pejoratively by
Derek Conway
.
[
32
]
In 1991 Cameron was seconded to
Downing Street
to work on briefing
John Major
for the then twice-weekly sessions of
Prime Minister's Questions
. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for "sharper ...
Despatch box
performances" by Major,
[
33
]
which included highlighting for Major "a dreadful piece of
doublespeak
" by
Tony Blair
(then the
Labour
Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national
minimum wage
.
[
34
]
He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow
Judith Chaplin
as political secretary to the prime minister.
[
35
]
Cameron lost to
Jonathan Hill
, who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, he was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the
1992 general election
.
[
36
]
During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young "brat pack" of party strategists who worked between 12 and

20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of
Alan Duncan
in
Gayfere Street
,
Westminster
, which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership.
[
37
]
Cameron headed the economic section. It was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with and befriended
Steve Hilton
, who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.
[
38
]
The strain of getting up at 04:45 every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.
[
39
]
Special adviser to the chancellor
The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying "whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right", and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across Smith Square to jeer at
Transport House
, the former Labour headquarters.
[
40
]
Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to
special adviser
to the
chancellor of the exchequer
,
Norman Lamont
.
[
41
]
Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of
Black Wednesday
, when pressure from currency speculators forced the
pound sterling
out of the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism
. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, he had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion,
Patricia Morris
, to contact him.
[
42
]
Later that month, Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the
Christian Democratic Union
; he was reported to be "still smarting" over the
Bundesbank
's contribution to the economic crisis.
[
43
]
Lamont fell out with John Major after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to
Conservative Campaign Headquarters
for their political acceptability to be assessed.
[
44
]
By May 1993, the Conservatives' average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the
1997 general election
.
[
45
]
Major and Lamont's personal ratings also declined dramatically. Lamont's

unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron, who was considered as a potential "
kamikaze
" candidate for the
Newbury by-election
, which includes the area where he grew up.
[
46
]
However, Cameron decided not to stand.
During the by-election, Lamont gave the response "
Je ne regrette rien
" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see "the green shoots of recovery" or admitting to "singing in his bath" with happiness at leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming chancellor himself, even though as he was not a member of Parliament he could not have been.
[
47
]
Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.
[
48
]
Special Adviser to the Home Secretary
The
Home Office building
where Cameron worked during the 1990s
After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the
Treasury
for less than a month before being specifically recruited by
Home Secretary
Michael Howard
. It was commented that he was still "very much in favour"
[
49
]
and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.
[
50
]
At the beginning of September 1993, he applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of
prospective parliamentary candidates
(PPCs).
[
51
]
Cameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him.
[
45
]
According to
Derek Lewis
, then Director-General of
Her Majesty's Prison Service
, Cameron showed him a "his and her list" of proposals made by Howard and his wife,
Sandra
. Lewis said that Sandra Howard's list included reducing the quality of
prison food
, although she denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was "uncomfortable" about the list.
[
52
]
In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist
Bruce Anderson
wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase "balanced diet", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.
[
53
]
During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed

the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the
Prevention of Terrorism Act
. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP
Peter Mandelson
demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.
[
54
]
[
55
]
A senior
Home Office
civil servant noted the influence of Howard's Special Advisers, saying previous incumbents "would listen to the evidence before making a decision. Howard just talks to young public school gentlemen from the party headquarters."
[
56
]
Carlton
In July 1994 Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at
Carlton Communications
.
[
57
]
Carlton, which had won the
ITV
franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman
Michael P. Green
by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor.
[
58
]
He left Carlton in 1997 to run for Parliament, returning to his job after his defeat.
In 1997 Cameron played up the company's prospects for
digital terrestrial television
, for which it joined with
ITV Granada
and
Sky
to form
British Digital Broadcasting
. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998, he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.
[
59
]
Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise, but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 to run for Parliament for a second time, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.
Parliamentary candidacies
Stafford
, the constituency Cameron contested at the
1997 general election
Having been approved for the PPCs' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the
1997 general election
. He was reported to have missed out on selection for
Ashford
in December 1994, after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays.
[
60
]
In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for
Stafford
, a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.
[
45
]
[
61
]
The incumbent Conservative MP,
Bill

Cash
, ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of
Stone
, where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for
tax cuts
in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going".
[
62
]
He also said the Party "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements ... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist prime ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion."
[
63
]
When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the
single European currency
clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy, but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.
[
64
]
Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national
party line
. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate,
David Kidney
, portrayed Cameron as "a right-wing Tory". Initially, Cameron thought he had a 50/50 chance, but as the campaign wore on and the scale of the impending Conservative defeat grew, Cameron prepared himself for defeat.
[
65
]
On election day, Stafford had a
swing
of 10.7%, almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: Kidney defeated Cameron by 24,606 votes (47.5%) to 20,292 (39.2%), a majority of 4,314 (8.3%).

In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the
2001 general election
, Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the
Kensington and Chelsea
seat after the death of
Alan Clark
, but did not make the shortlist. He was in the final two but narrowly lost at
Wealden
in March 2000,
[
68
]
a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.
[
69
]
Cameron was selected as PPC for
Witney
in Oxfordshire in April 2000. This had been a safe Conservative seat, but its sitting MP
Shaun Woodward
(who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had

"crossed the floor" to join the Labour Party, and was selected instead for the safe Labour seat of
St Helens South
. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe the two men as being "on fairly friendly terms".
[
70
]
Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend
Catherine Fall
, put a great deal of effort into "nursing" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on
fox hunting
to support a ban.
[
71
]
During the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for
The Guardian
'
s online section.
[
72
]
He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives, taking 22,153 votes (45%) to Labour candidate Michael Bartlet's 14,180 (28.8%), a majority of 7,973 (16.2%).
[
73

[

]
Parliamentary backbencher
Upon his election to Parliament, Cameron served as a member of the Commons
Home Affairs Select Committee
, a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP. He proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs,
[
75
]
and urged the consideration of "radical options".
[
76
]
The report recommended a downgrading of
ecstasy
from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of '
harm reduction
', which Cameron defended.
[
77
]
Cameron endorsed
Iain Duncan Smith
in the
2001 Conservative Party leadership election
and organised an event in Witney for party supporters to hear
John Bercow
speaking for him.
[
78
]
Two days before Duncan Smith won the leadership contest on 13 September 2001, the
9/11 attacks
occurred. Cameron described Tony Blair's response to the attacks as "masterful", saying: "He moved fast, and set the agenda both at home and abroad. He correctly identified the problem of
Islamist extremism
, the inadequacy of our response both domestically and internationally, and supported—quite rightly in my view—the action to
remove the Taliban regime from Afghanistan
."
[
79
]
Cameron determinedly attempted to increase his public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned as head of the
Commission for Racial Equality
after a confrontation with the police;
[
80
]
and commented that the Home Affairs Select Committee had taken a long time to discuss whether the phrase "black market" should be used.

[
81
]
Cameron was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002. Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally
George Osborne
to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same-sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted.
[
82
]
The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership.
Parliamentary frontbencher
In June 2003 Cameron was appointed a
shadow minister
in the
Privy Council Office
as a deputy to
Eric Forth
, then
shadow leader of the House
. He also became a vice-
chairman of the Conservative Party
when Michael Howard took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed Opposition frontbench
local government
spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the
Shadow Cabinet
that June as
head of policy co-ordination
. Later, he became
Shadow Education Secretary
in the post-election reshuffle.
[
83
]
[
84
]
Daniel Finkelstein
has said of the period leading up to Cameron's election as leader of the Conservative party that "a small group of us (myself, David Cameron, George Osborne,
Michael Gove
,
Nick Boles
,
Nick Herbert
I think, once or twice) used to meet up in the offices of
Policy Exchange
, eat pizza, and consider the future of the Conservative Party".
[
85
]
Cameron's relationship with Osborne is regarded as particularly close; Conservative MP
Nadhim Zahawi
suggested the closeness of Osborne's relationship with Cameron meant the two effectively shared power during Cameron's time as prime minister.
[

From February 2002 to August 2005, he was a
non-executive director
of Urbium PLC, operator of the
Tiger Tiger
bar chain.

Michael Ancram
,
Oliver Letwin

William Hague
.
[

His campaign did not gain wide support until his speech, delivered without notes, at the 2005 Conservative
party conference
. In the speech, he vowed to make people "feel good about being Conservatives again" and said he wanted "to switch on a whole new generation".
[
90

His speech was well-received;
The Daily Telegraph
said speaking without notes "showed a sureness and a confidence that is greatly to his credit".
[

In the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Cameron came second, with 56 votes, slightly more than expected;
David Davis
had fewer than predicted at 62 votes;
Liam Fox
came third with 42 votes; and
Kenneth Clarke
was eliminated with 38 votes. In the second ballot on 20 October 2005, Cameron came first with 90 votes; David Davis was second, with 57; and Liam Fox was eliminated with 51 votes.
[
92
]
All 198 Conservative MPs voted in both ballots.
The next stage of the election process, between Davis and Cameron, was a vote open to the entire party membership. Cameron was elected with more than twice as many votes as Davis and more than half of all ballots issued; Cameron won 134,446 votes on a 78%
turnout
, to Davis's 64,398.
[
93
]
Although Davis had initially been the favourite, it was widely acknowledged that his candidacy was marred by a disappointing conference speech.
[
94
]
Cameron's election as the leader of the Conservative Party and
leader of the opposition
was announced on 6 December 2005. As is customary for an opposition leader not already a member, upon election Cameron became a member of the
Privy Council
, being formally approved to join on 14 December 2005, and sworn of the council on 8 March 2006.
[

Reaction to Cameron as Leader
In an interview at the headquarters of
Oxfam
in 2006
Cameron's relative youth, moderate image, and inexperience before becoming leader invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair.
Private Eye
soon published a picture of both leaders on its front cover, with the caption "World's first face transplant a success".
[
96
]
On the left, the
New Statesman
unfavourably likened his "new style of politics" to Tony Blair's early leadership years.
[
97
]
Cameron was accused of paying excessive attention to appearance:

ITV News
broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in
Bournemouth
showing him wearing four different sets of clothes within a few hours.
[
98
]
In his column for
The Guardian
, comedy writer and broadcaster
Charlie Brooker
described the Conservative leader as "a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside" in April 2007.
[
99
]
On the right of the party,
Norman Tebbit
, a former Conservative chairman, likened Cameron to
Pol Pot
, "intent on purging even the memory of
Thatcherism
before building a New Modern Compassionate Green Globally Aware Party".
[
100
]
Quentin Davies
, who defected from the Conservatives to Labour on 26 June 2007, branded him "superficial, unreliable and [with] an apparent lack of any clear convictions" and stated that Cameron had turned the Conservative Party's mission into a "PR agenda".
[
101
]
Traditionalist conservative
columnist and author
Peter Hitchens
wrote: "Mr Cameron has abandoned the last significant difference between his party and the established left", by embracing social liberalism.
[
102
]
The Daily Telegraph
correspondent and blogger
Gerald Warner
was particularly scathing about Cameron's leadership, saying that it alienated traditionalist conservative elements from the Conservative Party.
[
103
]
Before he became Conservative leader, Cameron was reportedly known to friends and family as "Dave", though his preference is "David" in public.
[
104
]
[
105
]
Labour used the slogan
Dave the Chameleon
in their
2006 local elections
party broadcast to portray Cameron as an ever-changing
populist
, which was criticised as
negative campaigning
by the Conservative press, including
The Daily Telegraph
,
[
106
]
though Cameron asserted the broadcast had become his daughter's "favourite video".
[
107
]
Allegations of recreational drug use
During the leadership election, allegations were made that Cameron had used cannabis and
cocaine
recreationally before becoming an MP.
[
108
]
Pressed on this point during the BBC television programme
Question Time
, Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to "err and stray" in their past.
[
109

During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign, he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking: "I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done. We all did."

Shadow Cabinet appointments
Further information:
Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron
Speaking at the Home Office on 13 May 2010
His Shadow Cabinet

appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader William Hague was appointed to the foreign affairs brief, while both George Osborne and David Davis were retained, as
shadow chancellor of the Exchequer
and
Shadow Home Secretary
, respectively. Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his
paternity leave
in February 2006.
[
110
]
In June 2008 Davis announced his intention to
resign as an MP
, and was immediately replaced as shadow home secretary by
Dominic Grieve
; Davis' surprise move was seen as a challenge to the changes introduced under Cameron's leadership.

With
Theresa May
, who was a member of the
Shadow Cabinet
from 1999 until 2010
A
reshuffle
of the Shadow Cabinet was undertaken in January 2009, with the chief change being the appointment of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke as Shadow Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Secretary. Cameron stated that "With Ken Clarke's arrival, we now have the best economic team." The reshuffle also saw eight other changes made.
[
112
]
European Conservatives and Reformists
During his successful 2005 campaign to be elected leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's
members of the European Parliament
would leave the
European People's Party
group, which had a "federalist" approach to the European Union.
[
113
]
Once elected, Cameron began discussions with right-wing and
Eurosceptic
parties in other European countries, mainly in eastern Europe; in July 2006, he concluded an agreement to form the
Movement for European Reform
with the Czech
Civic Democratic Party
, leading to the formation of a new European Parliament group, the
European Conservatives and Reformists
, in 2009 after the
European Parliament elections
.
[
114
]
Cameron attended a gathering at
Warsaw
's Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the alliance.
[
115
]
In forming the caucus, which had 54 MEPs drawn from eight of the 27
EU member states
, Cameron reportedly broke with two decades of Conservative co-operation with the centre-right Christian Democrats, the European People's Party (EPP),
[
116
]
on the grounds that they are dominated by European
federalists
and supporters of the
Lisbon treaty
.
[
116
]
EPP leader
Wilfried Martens
, former
prime minister of Belgium
, stated: "Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one

major exception: Europe. ... I can't understand his tactics.
Merkel
and
Sarkozy
will never accept his Euroscepticism."
[
116
]
Shortlists for Parliamentary candidates
Similarly, Cameron's initial "
A-List
" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party,
[
117
]
and the policy was discontinued in favour of
gender
-balanced final shortlists. Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman
Ann Widdecombe
as an "insult to women", and she had accused Cameron of "storing up huge problems for the future".
[
118
]
South Africa
In April 2009
The Independent
reported that in 1989, while
Nelson Mandela
remained imprisoned under the
apartheid
regime, Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for him responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to
sanctions
against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip "jolly", saying that "it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The
Botha
regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence." Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP
Peter Hain
, himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.
[
119
]
Raising teaching standards
At the launch of the Conservative Party's education
manifesto
in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the "brazenly elite" approach to education of countries such as
Singapore
and
South Korea
, and expressed a desire to "elevate the status of teaching in our country".
[
120
]
He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching, and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from "good" universities.
[
121
]
Wes Streeting
, then president of the
National Union of Students
, said: "The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much."
[
122
]
Expenses
During the
parliamentary expenses scandal
in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying "excessive" expenses and threatened

to expel MPs that refused, after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:
We have to acknowledge just how bad this is, the public are really angry and we have to start by saying, "Look, this system that we have, that we used, that we operated, that we took part in—it was wrong and we are sorry about that".
[
123
]
A day later
The Daily Telegraph
published figures showing over five years he had claimed £82,450 on his second home allowance.
[
124
]
Cameron repaid £680 claimed for repairs to his constituency home.
[
125
]
Although he was not accused of breaking any rules, Cameron was placed on the defensive over mortgage interest expense claims covering his constituency home, after a report in
The Mail on Sunday
suggested he could have reduced the mortgage interest bill by putting an additional £75,000 of his own money towards purchasing the home in Witney, instead of paying off an earlier mortgage on his London home.
[
126
]
Cameron said that doing things differently would not have saved the taxpayer any money, as he was paying more on mortgage interest than he was able to reclaim as expenses anyway.
[
126
]
He also spoke out in favour of laws giving voters the power to "recall" or "sack" MPs accused of wrongdoing.
[
126
]
In April 2014 he was criticised for his handling of the expenses row surrounding Culture Secretary
Maria Miller
, when he rejected calls from fellow Conservative MPs to sack her from the front bench.

At age 43, Cameron became the youngest prime minister since
Lord Liverpool
in 1812, beating the record previously set by Tony Blair in May 1997.
[
131

In his first address outside
10 Downing Street
, he announced his intention to form a
coalition government
, the first since the
Second World War
, with the Liberal Democrats.
[
132
]
Nick Clegg and I are both political leaders that want to put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest. I believe that is the best way to get the strong government that we need, decisive government that we need today. This is going to be hard and difficult work. A coalition will throw up all sorts of challenges. But I believe together we can provide that strong and stable government that our country needs based on those values – rebuilding family, rebuilding community, above all, rebuilding responsibility in our country.
— David Cameron during his first speech as prime minister, 12 May 2010
Cameron outlined how he intended to "put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest".
[
131
]
As one of his first moves Cameron appointed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as deputy prime minister on 11 May 2010.
[
130
]
Between them, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats controlled 363 seats in the House of Commons, giving them a comfortable majority of 76 seats.
[
133
]
With Clegg in 2010 after entering government
In June 2010, Cameron described the economic situation as he came to power as "even worse than we thought" and warned of "difficult decisions" to be made over spending cuts.
[
134
]
By the beginning of

2015, he was able to claim that
his government's austerity programme
had succeeded in halving the
budget deficit
, although as a percentage of
GDP
rather than in cash terms.
[
135
]
In December 2010, Cameron attended a meeting with
FIFA
vice-president
Chung Mong-joon
, in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.
[

]
[
137
]
Domestic affairs
Welfare and benefits
Upon entering office in May 2010, Cameron positioned social reform as integral to his government's broader ambition to tackle poverty and restore social responsibility. He promoted a "life chances" agenda that framed poverty not only in material terms, but in terms of a lack of opportunity and generational disadvantage. The government announced its intention to adopt a "lifecycle approach" targeting family life, education, mental health and addiction through coordinated interventions across those domains.
[
138
]
[
139
]
Cameron extended reforms into broader public services through the "
Big Society
" agenda. A 2011 white paper proposed opening schools, hospitals, and council-run services to non‑public providers under "payment‑by‑results" contracts, with aims of improving efficiency and innovation through increased choice and competition.
[
140
]
In December 2015, due to sustained concern over failing children's services, Cameron announced that persistently underperforming local authorities would be required to transfer services to high‑performing councils, independent charities, or spin‑out organisations—a structural reform intended to improve outcomes and accountability.
[
141
]
Cameron's also government enacted welfare reforms, including the introduction of
Universal Credit
and the so‐called "
bedroom tax
", aimed at reducing welfare spending and encouraging labour market participation. These reforms were linked in academic studies to negative social outcomes—such as increased crime and welfare losses in deprived areas—even beyond fiscal savings.
[
142
]
[
143
]
Cameron's government in May 2016 directed reforms specifically for social workers and those leaving care. Legislation envisaged a statutory care‑leaver covenant obliging local authorities to provide detailed entitlements up to age 25 in areas such as housing, employment, and health support. Additionally, mandatory mentoring for care‑leavers and a shift in the balance of decision‑making to favor adoption over temporary foster placements were introduced to promote stability for vulnerable children.
[
144
]
[
145
]
Constitutional referendums
As a part of the deal to enter into coalition with the
Liberal Democrats
, the Conservatives pledged to hold a
referendum

on a
2011 alternative voting system
.
[
146
]
The referendum was held in May 2011 and proposed replacing the current
first-past-the-post voting system
with an
alternative voting system
, it was defeated at the polls and later go on to be a catalyst for the fall of the Liberal Democrats.
[
147
]
Cameron agreed to holding the
2014 Scottish independence referendum
and eliminated the "
devomax
" option from the ballot for a straight out yes or no vote. His support for the successful
Better Together
campaign extended to making a successful request to the Queen to intervene.
[
148
]
He had also backed a successful campaign to retain the status quo in a
referendum on changing the voting system
, held at the request of his coalition partners. The 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union meant that his tenure as British prime minister saw an unprecedented three referendums on the UK's constitutional future.
Social reforms
At
Prime Minister's Questions
in 2012
Cameron supported the introduction of
gay marriage
, despite more of his own Conservative MPs voting against the move than for it, meaning the support of Lib Dem MPs in government and Labour MPs in opposition was required to allow it to pass.
[
149
]
Earlier in his term, he had managed to secure a huge majority for UK participation in UN-backed military action in Libya,
[
150
]
but Cameron became the first prime minister
since 1782
to lose a foreign policy vote in the House of Commons over proposed military action against
Bashar al-Assad
's regime in Syria.
[
151
]
[
152
]
Subsequently, Barack Obama asked
congressional approval
,
[
153
]
which was not ultimately granted.
Education
Cameron advocated a substantial expansion of
academy
and
free school
provision in England, positioning them as central to improving standards. From May 2010 to mid‑2014, the number of academies soared from 203 to over 4,600, with more than half of secondary schools operating under academy status by mid‑2013.
[
154
]
He pledged to open at least 500 additional free schools by 2020, aiming to create around 270,000 new places, and announced the launch of 31 free schools in mid‑2016 alone, offering approximately 20,000 extra places.
[
155
]
Under Cameron's government, the national curriculum underwent revision to make it more challenging for
state schools
embedding early

exposure to subjects such as
computing
, advanced
mathematics
,
geography
and
history
thinking from age five onwards.
[
156
]
In December 2014, his government launched a £67 million initiative to retrain approximately 15,000 teachers in
STEM
subjects, and offered bursaries to attract top university graduates in maths and physics into teaching roles.
[
157
]
Parallel to this were proposals for a
National Teaching Service
designed to deploy high‑quality educators to poorly performing schools, and expanded powers for regional school commissioners to intervene swiftly in inadequately rated schools.
[
158
]
Cameron introduced the
pupil premium
in 2011, allocating additional per-pupil funding to schools serving students eligible for free school meals. The aim was to mitigate socioeconomic disparities by directing more resources to disadvantaged pupils, supporting social mobility through enhanced educational opportunity.

[

]
In response to the
Great Recession
, Cameron undertook the austerity programme. This was presented by the Cameron administration as deficit reduction programme consisting of sustained reductions in public spending, which the government argued would reduce the
government budget deficit
and the
welfare state in the United Kingdom
. The
National Health Service
[
162
]
and education
[
163
]
were "
ringfenced
" and protected from direct spending cuts.
[
164
]
Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne claimed they aimed to eliminate the structural deficit (i.e. deficit on current spending as opposed to investment), and to have government debt falling as a percentage of GDP.
[
165
]
By 2015 the deficit as a percentage of GDP had reduced to half what it was in 2010.
[
165
]
Cameron jointly with Osborne, introduced an
austerity
‑based fiscal strategy which they claimed was aiming to sharply reduce the public deficit that had ballooned in the wake of the
2008 financial crisis
. The programme relied primarily on reductions in public spending—approximately 5% of GDP over the coalition period—while protecting day‑to‑day budgets for the
NHS
, education, and international development. Tax reforms accompanied spending cuts, including a
VAT
rise from 17.5% to 20%, increased
National Insurance
contributions, alongside reductions in the higher rate of income tax (from 50% to 45%) and corporation tax cuts from 28% to 19%. By 2015, the structural deficit as a

percentage of GDP had roughly halved relative to 2010.
[
166
]
Between 2010 and mid-2015, unemployment fell from around 7.9% to about 5.5% as employment expanded by roughly 2.45 million jobs.
[
167
]
[
168
]
[
169
]
Economic growth remained modest, often described as sluggish, with GDP growth rates of around 0.4–0.8 % in the later years of the coalition. While the deficit declined, national debt rose from circa 71% of GDP in 2010 to approximately 84% by 2016.
[
170
]
Critics and some economic commentators have argued that austerity slowed recovery and constrained growth — illustrating the risk of premature fiscal tightening in a weak economy.
[
171
]
Immigration
Cameron said immigration from outside the EU should be subject to annual limits. He said in July 2013 that "in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great."
[
172
]
In 2015
The Independent
reported: "The Conservatives have failed spectacularly to deliver their pledge to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year. The
Office for National Statistics
(ONS) announced a net flow of 298,000 migrants to the UK in the 12 months to September 2014—up from 210,000 in the previous year."

In 2014 Cameron dismissed warnings that his cuts to the UK defence budget had left it less than a "first class-player in terms of defence" and no longer a "full partner" to the United States.

In the
July 2015 budget
, Chancellor George Osborne announced that the UK defence spending would meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP.

Cameron condemned the violence used against anti-Gaddafi protesters at the beginning of the
Libyan Civil War
[
176
]
After weeks of lobbying by the UK and its allies, on 17 March 2011, the
United Nations Security Council
approved a
no-fly zone
to prevent government forces loyal to
Muammar Gaddafi
from carrying out air attacks on

anti-Gaddafi rebels
.
[
177
]
Two days later, the UK and the United States fired more than 110
Tomahawk missiles
at targets in Libya.
[
178
]
Cameron said he was "proud" of the role United Kingdom played in the overthrow of Gaddafi's government.
[
179
]
Cameron also stated that UK had played a "very important role",
[
180
]
adding that "a lot of people said that Tripoli was completely different to Benghazi and that the two don't get on—they were wrong. ... People who said 'this is all going to be an enormous swamp of Islamists and extremists'—they were wrong".
[
181
]
In 2015 through 2016 the
Foreign Affairs Select Committee
conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated, and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By mid-2011, the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of
regime change
. However, that new policy did not include proper support for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya, and the growth of
ISIL
in North Africa. It concluded that Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.
[
182

[
183

[

US president Barack Obama also acknowledged there had been issues with following up the conflict planning, commenting in an interview with
The Atlantic
that Cameron had allowed himself to be "distracted by a range of other things".

Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute
In 2013 in response to Argentina's calls for negotiations over the
Falkland Islands
' sovereignty,
a referendum
was called, asking
Falkland Islanders
whether they supported the continuation of their status as an
Overseas Territory
of the United Kingdom. With a turnout of 91.94%, an overwhelming 99.8% voted to remain a British territory, with only three votes against.
[
188
]
In light of this, Cameron said: "We believe in the Falkland islanders' right to self-determination. They had a referendum. They couldn't have been more clear about wanting to remain with our country and we should protect and defend them".

Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia
.
[

In January 2015 he travelled to the Saudi capital
Riyadh
to pay his respects, following the death of the nation's
King Abdullah
. According to
WikiLeaks
, Cameron initiated a secret deal with Saudi Arabia, ensuring both countries were elected onto the
UN Human Rights Council
.
[
191
]
The same year his government announced "firm political support" for the
Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
against the
Shi'a
Houthis
,
[

re-supplying the Saudi military with weapons and providing them with training.

Sri Lanka
Cameron reiterated calls for an independent investigation into the
alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War
.
[
196
]
"There needs to be proper inquiries into what happened at the end of the war, there needs to be proper human rights, democracy for the
Tamil minority
in that country" Cameron stated.
[
197
]
[
198
]
He stated that, if this investigation was not completed by March 2014, he would press for an independent international inquiry.
[
199
]
[

[

]
This followed a visit to
Jaffna
, a war-ravaged town in the northern part of Sri Lanka; Cameron was the first foreign leader to visit Jaffna since the island once colonised by Britain became independent in 1948.

Cameron was mobbed by demonstrators, mostly women, seeking his assistance in tracing

Turkey
In a speech in
Ankara
in July 2010, Cameron stated unequivocally his support for
Turkey's accession to the EU
, citing economic, security and political considerations, and claimed that those who opposed Turkish membership were driven by "protectionism, narrow nationalism or prejudice".
[
206
]
[
207
]
In that speech, he was also critical of Israeli action during the
Gaza flotilla raid
– which had killed nine Turkish activists – and
its Gaza policy
, and repeated his opinion that Israel had turned Gaza into a "prison camp",
[
206
]
having previously referred to Gaza as "a giant open prison".
[
208
]
These views were met with mixed reactions.
[
209
]
[
210
]
The Cameron government declined to formally recognise
the Ottoman Empire's massacres

of Armenians
as a "genocide".
[
211
]
During the EU referendum campaign, Cameron stated that Turkey was unlikely to be ready to join the EU "until the year 3000", at its current rate of progress.
[
212
]
Israel
At the end of May 2011 Cameron stepped down as patron of the
Jewish National Fund
,
[
213
]
[
214
]
becoming the first British prime minister not to be patron of the charity in the 110 years of its existence.
[
215
]
In a speech in 2011, Cameron said: "You have a prime minister whose commitment and determination to work for peace in Israel is deep and strong. Britain will continue to push for peace, but will always stand up for Israel against those who wish her harm". He said he wanted to reaffirm his "unshakable" belief in Israel within the same message.
[
216
]
He also voiced his opposition to the
Goldstone Report
, claiming it had been biased against Israel and not enough blame had been placed on Hamas.
In March 2014, during his first visit to Israel as prime minister, Cameron addressed Israel's
Knesset
in
Jerusalem
, where he offered his full support for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians, hoping a two-state solution might be achieved.
[
217
]
He also made clear his rejection of trade or academic boycotts against Israel,
[
218
]
acknowledged Israel's right to defend its citizens as "a right enshrined in international law", and made note of the
Balfour Declaration
of 1917, as "the moment when the State of Israel went from a dream to a plan, Britain has played a proud and vital role in helping to secure Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people."
[
217
]
During his two-day visit, he met with Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
and with Palestinian Authority president
Mahmoud Abbas
.
[
219
]
Senior Foreign Office minister
Baroness Warsi
resigned over the Cameron government's decision not to condemn Israel for the
2014 Israel–Gaza conflict
, saying that the government's "approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible".

Military intervention in Iraq and Syria

Meeting
Barack Obama
during the
2010 G20 Toronto summit
In August 2013 Cameron lost a motion in favour of bombing Syrian armed forces in response to the
Ghouta chemical

attack
, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782.
[
221
]
In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request of the Iraqi government, a bombing campaign against
Islamic State
(IS) targets in Iraq;
[
222
]
the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria.
[
223
]
Cameron promised that, before expanding
UK air strikes and ground support
to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval.
[
224
]
In July 2015 a
Freedom of Information
(FOI) request by
Reprieve
revealed that, without the knowledge of UK parliamentarians, RAF pilots had, in fact, been bombing targets in Syria, and that Cameron knew of this.
[
225
]
[
226
]
The Prime Minister, along with Defence Secretary
Michael Fallon
, faced strong criticism, including from Conservative MPs, for not informing the Commons about this deployment; the Ministry of Defence said that the pilots concerned were "embedded" with foreign military forces, and so were "effectively" operating as such, while Fallon denied that MPs had been, as he put it, "kept in the dark".
[
227
]
[
228
]
[
229
]
The Reprieve FoI request also revealed that British drone pilots had been embedded, almost continuously, with American forces at
Creech Air Force Base
since 2008. These drone operators, who were "a gift of services", meaning the UK still paid their salaries and covered their expenses, had been carrying out operations that included reconnaissance in Syria to assist American strikes against IS.
[
230
]
Fallon said that it was "illogical" for the UK not to bomb ISIL in Syria, for the organisation does not "differentiate between Syria and Iraq" and is "organised and directed and administered from Syria".
[
231
]
Following the
terrorist attacks on Paris
in November 2015, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility, Cameron began pushing for a strategy for the
Royal Air Force
to bomb Syria in retaliation.
[
232
]
Cameron set out his case for military intervention to Parliament on 26 November, telling MPs that it was the only way to guarantee Britain's safety, and would be part of a "comprehensive" strategy to defeat IS.
[
233
]
On 3 December 2015, MPs voted 397–223 in favour of launching air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. The vote for military action

was supported by all but seven members of the Parliamentary Conservative Party, as well as 66 Labour MPs who backed the government in defiance of their leader,
Jeremy Corbyn
, who had expressed his opposition to air strikes.

Cameron was re-elected UK prime minister on 7 May 2015 with a majority in the Commons.
[

The Conservative Party's decisive victory in the general election was a surprise, as most polls and commentators had suggested the outcome was too close to call and that the result would be a second hung parliament.
[
236
]
Cameron said of his first term when returned as prime minister for a second term that he was "proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years" and offered particular thanks to Clegg for his role in it.
[

Forming the first
Conservative majority government
elected since
1992
, David Cameron became the first prime minister to be re-elected immediately after a full term with a larger popular vote share since
Lord Salisbury
at the
1900 general election
.
In response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, Cameron secured the support of the House of Commons to extend air strikes against
ISIS
into Syria.
[

Earlier that year, Cameron had outlined a five-year strategy to counter Islamist extremism and subversive teachings.

2016 referendum and resignation
Announcing his resignation as prime minister following the UK vote to leave EU membership, June 2016
As promised in the election manifesto, Cameron set a date for a
referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union
, and announced that he would be campaigning for Britain to remain within a "reformed EU".
[
240
]
The terms of the UK's membership of the EU were
re-negotiated
, with agreement reached in February 2016.
[
241
]
The option to leave came to be known as
Brexit
(a
portmanteau
of "British" and "exit").
The referendum was held on 23 June 2016. The result was approximately 52% in favour of leaving the European Union and 48% against, with a turnout of 72%.
[
242
]
[
243
]
On 24 June, a few hours after the results became known, Cameron announced that he would resign the office of prime minister

by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. In a speech the next day outside 10 Downing Street, he stated that, on account of his own advocacy on behalf of remaining in the EU: "I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination."
[
244
]
[
245
]
[
246
]
[
247
]
There was some strong criticism made of Cameron and his government following the referendum. Matthew Norman, in an opinion piece in
The Independent
, called the referendum an act of "indescribably selfish recklessness".
[
248
]
In late July, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee was told that Cameron had refused to allow the Civil Service to make plans for Brexit, a decision the committee described as "an act of gross negligence".
[
249
]
His farewell speech as he left No. 10 accompanied by his family stressed the value of selfless public service.
[
250
]
The
Conservative Party leadership election
was scheduled for 9 September and the new leader was expected to be in place by the autumn conference, set to begin on 2 October.
[
251
]
On 11 July, following the withdrawal of
Andrea Leadsom
from the Conservative Party leadership election and the confirmation of
Theresa May
as the new
leader of the Conservative Party
, Cameron announced he would hold a final cabinet meeting on 12 July and then, following a final Prime Minister's Questions, submit his resignation to the Queen on the afternoon of 13 July. Cameron delivered his resignation speech in front of 10 Downing Street on 11 July. Cameron's resignation speech attracted further attention when he walked away humming a tune, picked up by microphone, after he had finished his speech.
[
252
]
After his final Prime Minister's Questions, Cameron received a standing ovation from MPs; his final comment was, "I was the future once"—a reference to his 2005 quip to Tony Blair, "he was the future once". Cameron then submitted his resignation to the Queen later that day.
[
253
]
Although no longer serving as prime minister, Cameron originally stated that he would continue inside Parliament, on the Conservative
backbenches
.
[
254
]
On 12 September, however, he announced that he was resigning his seat with immediate effect,
[
255
]
and was appointed to the

Manor of Northstead
. He was succeeded as MP for Witney by fellow Conservative
Robert Courts
.
[
256

The Washington Post
described him as having "sped away without glancing back" once
Theresa May
had "vaulted herself out of the hurricane-strength political wreckage of Britain's vote to leave the European Union."

Brexit
Cameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as prime minister and the subsequent
Brexit negotiations
. In January 2019, following May's defeat in the House of Commons over her draft withdrawal agreement, Cameron gave a rare interview to reporters outside his house in
Notting Hill
, saying he backed May's Brexit deal with the EU and did not regret calling the 2016 referendum.
[
262
]
However, he later said that the outcome of the referendum had left him "hugely depressed", and told
The Times
he knew "some people will never forgive me". He confessed: "Every single day I think about it, and the fact that we lost, and the consequences, and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately".
[
263
]
In the months following Boris Johnson's election as prime minister, Cameron began criticising Johnson's Brexit strategy, including his decision to
prorogue
parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 October, and the removal of the whip from Conservative MPs who voted to block a
no-deal Brexit
. Additionally,

he accused Johnson, as well as Michael Gove, of behaving "appallingly" during the referendum campaign of 2016.
[
263
]
In September 2020, Cameron became the fifth former prime minister to criticise the
UK Internal Market Bill
, over which he said he had "misgivings". He said the "bigger picture" was about trying to get a trade deal with the EU, urging the government to "keep that context [and] that big prize in mind."

Memoir

For the Record (book)
Cameron published a memoir,
For the Record

]
He was reported to have signed an £800,000 contract for the book.
[
266

According to the
Guardian
, the book was initially scheduled for 2018, but was delayed so Cameron would not be perceived as a "backstreet driver" in the ongoing Brexit negotiations.
[
265
]
[
267

The book gives an insight into his life at
10 Downing Street
, as well as inside explanations of the decisions taken by his government. Cameron said that his aim in writing the book was to "correct the record" where he thought it was wrong.

Greensill scandal
Further information:
Greensill scandal
During Cameron's premiership, the financier
Lex Greensill
was an unpaid advisor who had access to eleven government departments.
[
269

In 2018 he became an advisor to
Greensill Capital
and held share options in the company
[
270
]
reportedly worth as much as $60 million as well as being paid over $1 million each year for 25 days' work per year.
[
269
]
[
271
]
A
Panorama
investigation concluded that, overall, through a combination of his salary and share sales, Cameron earned around $10 million before tax for 30 months' part-time work.
[
272
]
In 2019 Cameron arranged for a private meeting with Lex Greensill and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
Matt Hancock
; under Hancock, several NHS trusts went on to use Greensill Capital's Earnd app.
[
273
]
In 2020 a few months before Greensill Capital collapsed, Cameron lobbied the government to bend the rules to allow it to receive
Covid Corporate Financing Facility
loans.
[
274
]
[
275
]
[
276

[
277

He sent several text messages to Chancellor of the Exchequer
Rishi Sunak
, who ultimately declined

to help Greensill; Cameron also held ten virtual meetings with permanent secretaries Tom Scholar and Charles Roxburgh to try to obtain money for Greensill.
[
269
]
[
278
]
[
279
]
The government-owned
British Business Bank
lent Greensill up to £400m through a different scheme, leading to a potential £335m loss to the taxpayer.
[

After press revelations in 2021 regarding the extent of Greensill Capital's access, a formal investigation was launched by the UK lobbying registrar to be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the

His tenure was dominated by the
Russian invasion of Ukraine
, the
Gaza war
, and the
Gaza humanitarian crisis
. Cameron visited 35 countries and territories during

his tenure as foreign secretary, and was deputised in the House of Commons by
Andrew Mitchell
. Cameron visited the site of the
Be'eri massacre
, part of the
2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel
, on 23 November to meet Israeli foreign minister
Eli Cohen
. Afterwards, he met the
Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu

Gaza
.
[

Cameron said in an interview with the BBC that he told Israeli officials that "they must abide by international humanitarian law" and that the number of
Palestinian casualties
was "too high". He also said that the "settler violence" against Palestinians in the occupied
West Bank
is "completely unacceptable".
[
293

Cameron backed a "sustainable ceasefire" in the Gaza Strip on 17 December, called for more aid to reach Gaza, and called for the Israeli government to "do more to discriminate sufficiently between terrorists and civilians". He, however, rejected calls for a "general and immediate ceasefire", differentiating this from the "sustainable ceasefire" he called for alongside German foreign minister
Annalena Baerbock
.

Cameron said in the same month that "Israel is acting in self-defence after the appalling attack on October 7" and denied that Israel is committing
war crimes in Gaza

[

]
saying he was a "
liberal Conservative
", though "not a deeply ideological person."
[
316
]
As leader of the opposition, Cameron asserted that he did not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and would offer his support in areas of agreement. He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and "general well-being", instead of focusing solely on "financial wealth".
[
317
]
There were claims that he described himself to journalists at a dinner during the leadership contest as the "heir to Blair".
[
318
]
In his first Conservative conference speech as party leader in Bournemouth in 2006, he described the National Health Service as "one of the 20th Century's greatest achievements". He went on to say: "
Tony Blair
explained his priorities in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: N.H.S." He also talked about his severely disabled son, Ivan, concluding: "So, for me, it is not just a question of saying the NHS is safe in my hands—of course it will be. My family is so often in the hands of the NHS, so I want them to be safe there."
[

With
Barack Obama
and then German chancellor
Angela Merkel
at
Deauville
, France, May 2011
Cameron said that he believed in "spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention" in cases such as the
genocide
in
Darfur
, Sudan. He said he rejected
neoconservatism
because, as a conservative, he recognises "the complexities of
human nature
, and will always be sceptical of grand schemes to remake the world."
[
320
]
A supporter of multilateralism, as "a country may act alone—but it cannot always succeed alone", he believes multilateralism can take the form of acting through "
NATO
, the UN, the
G8
, the EU and other institutions", or through international
alliances
.
[
321
]
Cameron said: "If the West is to help other countries, we must do so from a position of genuine moral authority"

and "we must strive above all for
legitimacy
in what we do."
[
321
]
Cameron believes that
British Muslims
have a duty to
integrate
into British culture, but noted in an article published in 2007, that the Muslim community finds aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and: "Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around."
[
322
]
In his first speech as PM on radicalisation and the causes of terrorism in February 2011, Cameron said that "state
multiculturalism
" had failed.
[
323
]
In 2010 he appointed the first Muslim member of the British cabinet, Baroness Warsi, as a minister without portfolio, and in 2012 made her a special minister of state in foreign affairs. She resigned, however, in August 2014 over the government's handling of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.
While urging members of his party to support the coalition's proposals for
same-sex marriage
, Cameron said that he backed gay marriage not in spite of his conservatism, but because he is a conservative, and claimed it was about equality.
[
324
]
In 2012 Cameron publicly apologised for Thatcher-era policies on homosexuality, specifically the introduction of the controversial
Section 28
of the
Local Government Act 1988
, which he described as "a mistake".

Poverty
Further information:
Political positions of David Cameron § Welfare
In 2006 Cameron described poverty as a "moral disgrace"
[
326
]
and promised to tackle
relative poverty
.
[
327
]
In 2007 Cameron promised: "We can make British poverty history, and we will make British poverty history". The same year he also stated: "Ending child poverty is central to improving child well-being".
[
328
]
In 2015
Polly Toynbee
questioned Cameron's commitment to tackling poverty, contrasting his earlier statements agreeing that "poverty is relative" with proposals to change the government's poverty measure, and saying that cuts in
child tax credits
would increase child poverty among low-paid working families.
[
329
]
Cameron denied that austerity had contributed to the
2011 England riots
, instead blaming street gangs and opportunistic looters.
[
330
]
LGBT rights
In 2010 Cameron was given a score of 36% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by
Stonewall
.
[
331
]
Prior

to 2005 Cameron was opposed to gay rights, calling it a "fringe agenda" and attacking Prime Minister Tony Blair for "moving heaven and earth to allow the promotion of homosexuality in our schools" by repealing the anti-gay Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988.
[
332
]
Cameron is recorded by
Hansard
as having voted against same-sex adoption rights in 2002, but he denies this, claiming he abstained from the
three-line whip
imposed on him by his party. In 2008, he wanted lesbians who receive IVF treatment to be required to name a father figure, which received condemnation from
LGBT
equality groups.
[
332
]
However, Cameron supported commitment for gay couples in a 2005 speech, and in October 2011 urged Conservative MPs to support gay marriage.
[
324
]
In November 2012 Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed to fast-track legislation for introducing same-sex marriage.
[
333
]
Cameron stated that he wanted to give religious groups the ability to host gay marriage ceremonies, and that he did not want to exclude gay people from a "great institution".
[
334
]
In 2013 the
Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013
became law despite opposition from more than half of his fellow Conservative MPs, including Cabinet ministers
Owen Paterson
and
David Jones
.
[
335
]
He also subsequently appointed two women who had voted against same-sex marriage as ministers in the
Government Equalities Office
,
Nicky Morgan
and
Caroline Dinenage
following the 2015 general election.
[
336
]
In August 2013 he rejected calls by
Stephen Fry
and others to strip Russia from hosting the
2014 Winter Olympics
due to its anti-gay laws.
[
337
]
Cameron did not attend the games, but denied it was a boycott in protest at Russia's laws, having previously raised the issue of gay rights in the country with
Vladimir Putin
.
[
338
]
Marriage and family values
In 2009 Cameron said "the restoration of family values and a new commitment to economic and social responsibility" were "key to repairing 'broken Britain
'
".
[
339
]
In 2013 Cameron described himself as "a marriage man, I am a great supporter of marriage. I want to promote marriage, defend marriage, encourage marriage." As such, he rejected calls from Conservative MP
Christopher Chope
to extend
civil partnership
rights to heterosexual couples, saying: "I think we should be promoting marriage rather than looking at

any other way of weakening it."
[
340
]
In 2018 the
Supreme Court
ruled unanimously that this position was discriminatory.
[
341
]
Assisted dying
In November 2024, Cameron announced he was in favour of
Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill
on assisted dying, having previously opposed legalising the practice.
[
342
]
Comments on other parties and politicians
Cameron criticised
Gordon Brown
(when Brown was
Chancellor of the Exchequer
) for being "an analogue politician in a digital age" and referred to him as "the roadblock to reform".
[
343
]
As prime minister, he reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the
International Monetary Fund
by hinting that he may block the appointment, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role.
[
344
]
He said that
John Prescott
"clearly looks a fool" after Prescott's personal indiscretions were revealed in spring 2006, and wondered if the Deputy Prime Minister had broken the ministerial code.
[
345
]
During a speech to the Ethnic Media Conference in November 2006, Cameron also described
Ken Livingstone
, the
mayor of London
, as an "ageing far left politician" following Livingstone's criticism of
Trevor Phillips
, head of the Commission for Racial Equality.
[

With his predecessors
Gordon Brown
, Tony Blair,
John Major
and Deputy PM
Nick Clegg
, during Barack Obama's address in Westminster Hall, June 2011
In April 2006 Cameron accused the
UK Independence Party
of being "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly",
[
347
]
leading UKIP MEP
Nigel Farage
(who became leader in September of that year) to demand an apology for the remarks. Right-wing Conservative MP
Bob Spink
, who later defected to UKIP, also criticised the remarks,
[
348
]
as did
The Daily Telegraph
.
[
349
]
Cameron was seen encouraging Conservative MPs to join the
standing ovation
given to
Tony Blair
at the end of his last Prime Minister's Question Time; he had paid tribute to the "huge efforts" Blair had made and said Blair had "considerable achievements to his credit, whether it is peace in Northern Ireland or his work in the developing world, which will endure".
[
350
]
In January 2007 Cameron made a speech in which he described extremist
Islamic
organisations and the
British National

Party
as "mirror images" to each other, both preaching "creeds of pure hatred".
[
351
]
Cameron is listed as being a supporter of
Unite Against Fascism
.
[
352
]
In September 2015 after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, Cameron called the party a "threat" to British national and economic security, on the basis of Corbyn's defence and fiscal policies.
[
353
]
Foreign affairs
Iraq War
In an interview on
Friday Night with Jonathan Ross
in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to
war in Iraq
, and said that he thought supporters should "see it through".
[
354
]
He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006, calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011 he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He repeatedly called for the
Chilcot Inquiry
into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying: "People want to know the truth".
[
355
]
India
Cameron was a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom, describing
Indian–British relations
as the "New
Special Relationship
" in 2010.
[
356
]
[
357
]
In October 2012 as
Narendra Modi
rose to prominence in India, the UK rescinded its boycott of the then-
Gujarat
state Chief Minister over
religious riots in Gujarat
in 2002 that left more than 2,000 dead,
[
358
]
and in November 2013, Cameron commented that he was "open" to meeting Modi.
[
359
]
Modi was later elected as prime minister in a landslide majority, leading to Cameron calling Modi and congratulating him on the "election success",
[
360
]
one of the first Western leaders to do so.
[
361
]
Israel
With Prime Minister of Israel
Benjamin Netanyahu
at Jerusalem, January 2024
In January 2024, Cameron dismissed
South Africa's
ICJ genocide case against Israel
as "nonsense", saying that Israel is "a democracy, a country with the rule of law, a country with armed forces that are committed to obeying the rule of law".
[
296
]
China
In October 2015
Xi Jinping
, the
president of the People's Republic of China
, paid a
state visit to the United Kingdom
under the Premiership of Cameron. Such episodes including the Chinese leader famously having a pint with Cameron

at a local pub in Buckinghamshire,
[
362
]
and Queen Elizabeth hailing the visit as "milestone" during state banquet,
[
363
]
symbolised the increased cordiality between China and the United Kingdom under Cameron, in spite of the controversies around the state visit and the concerns with China's superpower status. The state visit was the third formal
Anglo–Chinese
diplomatic meetings, which involves either head of states or head of governments, following Cameron's visit to China in 2013 and then–Premier
Li Keqiang
's UK visit in 2014; the year 2015 alone also marked an unprecedented level of bilateral meetings and visits.
[
364
]
The unprecedented level of friendly relations with China has also led to many, including the PRC and Cameron himself, marking his premiership as a "golden-era" of UK–China relations, where bilateral cooperation between the countries reached its apex. The UK government was even seen expressing interests in participating in Chinese diplomatic projects under Xi Jinping, such as the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
(AIIB) and the
Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI).
[
365
]
By 2023, upon Cameron's appointment as foreign secretary, eight years apart from the state visit of Xi, he was associating by media outlets, home and abroad, with the keyword "golden era",
[
366
]
even dubbing Cameron himself as "Lord Golden Era",
[
367
]
prompting concerns over the stances of the
Sunak government
towards China as the latter welcomed Cameron's appointment as foreign secretary.
[
368
]
Russia
With Russian president
Vladimir Putin
at the
G20 Antalya summit
, Turkey, 16 November 2015
In the years after Cameron became UK prime minister, UK relations with Russia initially showed a marked improvement. In 2011 Cameron visited Russia, and in 2012, Putin visited the UK for the first time in seven years, holding talks with Cameron, and also visiting the
2012 London Olympics
together.
[
369
]
In May 2013 Cameron flew to meet Putin at his summer residence in
Sochi
, Bocharov Ruchei, to hold talks on the
Syria
crisis. Cameron described the talks as "very substantive, purposeful and useful", and the leaders exchanged presents with each other. At that time, it was suggested that Cameron could use his good relations with both US president
Barack Obama
, and President Putin to act as a 'go-between' in international relations.
[
370
]
However, Cameron's relations to Russia soured drastically following the
Russo-Ukrainian War
.

Cameron criticised the
2014 Crimean status referendum
as a "sham", with voters having "voted under the barrel of a
Kalashnikov
", stating "Russia has sought to annex Crimea.... This is a flagrant breach of international law and something we will not recognise."
[
371
]
Cameron has gone on to be a fierce critic of Russia, and Putin, and supporter of Ukraine.
[
372
]
Political image
"Dodgy Dave" moniker
In April 2016 then Labour MP for Bolsover,
Dennis Skinner
was reprimanded by House Speaker John Bercow for referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' (related to Skinner's contention of Cameron's dishonesty) in a parliamentary debate about the
Panama Papers
. Skinner was instructed by Bercow to repeat his question without referring to Cameron using the adjective 'dodgy'. When Skinner repeated his question, once again referring to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave', he was ordered to leave parliament for the remainder of that day's session.
[
373
]
[
374
]
In July 2016, Skinner once again referred to Cameron as 'Dodgy Dave' in parliament, however this time he was not reprimanded, or asked to leave.
[
375
]
"Dodgy Dave" has gained usage in the media, and on social media, when Cameron is being referred to disparagingly.

Allegations of social elitism
Speaking at a Conservative reception in 2008
As leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron was accused of relying on "old-boy networks", and criticised by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority prospective parliamentary candidates.
[
381
]
[
117
]
Several of Cameron's senior appointments, such as George Osborne as chancellor of the Exchequer, are former members of the Bullingdon Club. Michael Gove conceded it was "ridiculous" how many fellow Cabinet ministers were old Etonians, though he placed the blame on the failings of the state education system rather than Cameron.
[
382
]
However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of
Standpoint
, wrote that Cameron's cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: "David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated—indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen".
[
383
]
Speaking in 2010
Plots against leadership
Following poor results in the
May 2012 local elections
after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead

in the polls, there were concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron's leadership and his electability.
David Davies
, the chairman of the
Welsh Affairs Select Committee
, accused the Conservative leadership of "incompetence", and hinted that it could risk Cameron's leadership.
[
384
]
Nadine Dorries
warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.
[
385
]
Later that year, Conservative MP
Brian Binley
openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a "maid" to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013, it was revealed that
Adam Afriyie
was planning his own bid for the Conservative leadership with the support of fellow MPs
Mark Field
,
Bill Wiggin
,
Chris Heaton-Harris
,
Patrick Mercer
,
Jonathan Djanogly
and
Dan Byles
.
The Times
and
ConservativeHome
revealed that a "rebel reserve" of 55 Conservative MPs gave firm pledges to a co-ordinating MP to support a motion of no confidence and write to Brady simultaneously, more than the 46 MPs needed to trigger a vote of no confidence.
[
386
]
Andrew Bridgen
openly called for a vote of confidence in Cameron's leadership, and claimed that the Prime Minister had a "credibility problem", but he dropped his bid for a contest a year later.
[
387
]
Cameron and Andy Coulson
In 2007 Cameron appointed
Andy Coulson
, former editor of the
News of the World
, as his director of communications. Coulson had resigned as the paper's editor following the conviction of a reporter in relation to
illegal phone hacking
, although stating that he knew nothing about it.
[
388
]
[
389
]
In June 2010, Downing Street confirmed Coulson's annual salary as £140,000, the highest pay of any special adviser to UK Government.
[
390
]
In January 2011, Coulson left his post, saying that coverage of the phone-hacking scandal was making it difficult to give his best to the job.
[
388
]
In July 2011, Coulson was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the
News of the World
, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the Leader of the Opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance.
[
391
]
The same month, in a special

parliamentary session at the
House of Commons
, arranged to discuss the News International phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he "regretted the furore" that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that "with hindsight" he would not have hired him.
[
392
]
Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by
Strathclyde Police
in May 2012.
[
393
]
[
394
]
Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a "full and frank" apology for hiring him, saying: "I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am very clear about that." The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the Prime Minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.
[
395
]
Cameron and Michael Ashcroft
Although
Lord Michael Ashcroft
played a significant role in the 2010 election, he was not offered a ministerial post.
[
396
]
In June 2012, shortly before a major Conservative rebellion on
House of Lords reform
,
[
397
]
journalist
Peter Oborne
credited Ashcroft with "stopping the Coalition working" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education and taxation to the right.
[
396
]
According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites and a "brutal critic of the Coalition from the start", had established "megaphone presence" in the on-line media. He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by "coordinated attacks on the Coalition" and "the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together."
[
396
]
In
The Observer
,
Andrew Rawnsley
commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to "generate publicity", "stir trouble for the Prime Minister" and influence the direction of the party.
[
398
]
In 2015, Ashcroft released
Call Me Dave
, an
unauthorised biography
of Cameron written with journalist
Isabel Oakeshott
, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as
Piggate
, in which he allegedly inserted his penis into a dead pig's head. No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a "revenge job" by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when

Cameron came to power in 2010.
[
399
]
[
400
]
Ashcroft initially claimed the book was "not about settling scores", while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 general election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances.
[
401
]
Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations "may have been case of mistaken identity" and has stated that he has a personal "beef" with Cameron.
[
399
]
[
400
]
[
402
]
[
403
]
[
404
]
Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it.
[
405

Standing in opinion polls
Protesters outside
10 Downing Street

Panama Papers
scandal, April 2016
An ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron rated the least popular of the three main party leaders.
[
406
]
[
407
]
A
YouGov
poll on party leaders conducted on 9–10 June 2011 found 44% of the electorate thought he was doing well and 50% thought he was doing badly, while 38% thought he would be the best PM and 35% did not know.
[
408
]
In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters thought he was doing well as prime minister compared with 46% who thought he was doing badly.
[
409
]
In September 2015, an Opinium poll had similar results to the one shortly before the election, with voters split with 42% who approved of him and 41% who did not.
[
410
]
Cameron had significantly better net approval ratings in polls conducting in December and January (getting −6 in both) than Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (who got −38 and −39).
[
411
]
However, following the Panama Papers leak in April 2016, his personal approval ratings fell below Corbyn's.
[
412
]
Evaluations of premiership
In the months immediately following his resignation from the post of prime minister, a number of commentators gave negative evaluations of Cameron's premiership. The
University of Leeds
'
2016 survey
of post-war prime ministers, which collected the views of 82 academics specialising in the history and politics of post-war Britain, ranked Cameron as the third-worst prime minister since

1945, ranking above only
Alec Douglas-Home
and
Anthony Eden
. 90% of respondents cited his calling and losing of the Brexit referendum as his greatest failure.
[
413

In popular culture
With
Holly Willoughby
and
Phillip Schofield
on the set of
This Morning
in 2013
Cameron made a cameo appearance in the
BBC
television programme
Top Gear
'
s
India Special
, where he tells the trio of
Jeremy Clarkson
,
James May
and
Richard Hammond
to "stay away from India" after initially denying the group's request to improve economic relations with India in a letter and suggested that they
mend fences with Mexico
. He later stated through his aides that he did not like the special that he cameoed in, and that he had the "utmost respect" for the people of India.

and Schofield presented him with a list he had obtained from the internet of five people named as paedophiles in connection with the
North Wales child abuse scandal
.
[

The names of several former senior Conservative politicians were visible on the list.
[
418

Cameron responded by warning against a witchhunt, "particularly about people who are gay".
[

Schofield was widely criticised for his action,
[
417

with broadcaster
Jonathan Dimbleby
describing his behaviour as "cretinous".
[
420
]
ITV's director of television,
Peter Fincham
, said that Schofield was "wrong" in confronting Cameron and the broadcaster had agreed to co-operate fully with government regulator
Ofcom
's investigation into the matter. The investigation was initiated after Ofcom received 415 complaints from viewers. Schofield later apologised, blaming a misjudged camera angle.
[

epilepsy
called
Ohtahara syndrome
, requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: "The news hits you like a freight train ... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful."

near the Cameron family home in
North Kensington
.
[
431
]
Cameron's constituency home is in
Dean, Oxfordshire
, and the Camerons have been described as key members of the
Chipping Norton set
.
[
432
]
It was announced that Cameron would miss Prime Minister's Questions on 8 September 2010 to fly to
southern France
to see his father, Ian Cameron, who had had a stroke with coronary complications. Later that day, his father died.
[
433
]
Cameron attended

a private ceremony for the funeral of his father on 17 September 2010 in Berkshire, which prevented him from hearing the address of
Pope Benedict XVI
in
Westminster Hall
, an occasion he would otherwise have attended.
[
434
]
In 2012 Cameron was criticised for leaving his daughter alone in a pub. Cameron had apparently left and forgotten her.
[
435
]
In 2025, Cameron revealed to
The Sunday Times
that the previous year he had been diagnosed with
prostate cancer
after his wife encouraged him to get
tested
.
[
436
]
Cameron added that he had undergone successful treatment to combat the disease.
[
437
]
He has since advocated for targeted screening programmes.
[

]
Inheritance and family wealth
In October 2010, Cameron inherited £300,000 from his father's estate. Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in
the City
of London, used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as
Jersey
, Panama City and
Geneva
, to increase the family wealth. In 1982, Ian Cameron created the Panamanian
Blairmore Holdings
, an
offshore investment
fund, valued at about $20 million in 1988, "not liable to taxation on its income or capital gains", which used
bearer shares
until 2006.
[
439
]
In April 2016, following the Panama Papers financial documents leak, Cameron faced calls to resign, after it was revealed that he and his wife Samantha had invested in Ian Cameron's offshore fund.
[
440
]
He owned £31,500 of shares in the fund and sold them for a profit of £19,000 shortly before becoming prime minister in 2010, which he paid full UK tax on.
[
441
]
Cameron argued that the fund was set up in Panama so that people who wanted to invest in dollar-denominated shares and companies could do so, and because full UK tax was paid on all profits he made, there was no impropriety.
[
442
]
A protest was held in London in April 2016, demanding Cameron's resignation.
[
443
]
[
444
]
In 2009 the
New Statesman
estimated his wealth at
£3.2 million
, adding that Cameron is expected to inherit "million-pound legacies" from both sides of his family.

Before becoming prime minister, Cameron regularly used his bicycle to commute to work. In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work, followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings. His Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently said that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time.
[
446

Cameron is an occasional jogger and in 2009 raised funds for charities by taking part in the Oxford 5K and the
Great Brook Run
.

A member of
MCC
, he is also a keen
cricket
fan and has appeared on
Test Match Special
.
[

A 2012 biography,
Cameron: Practically a Conservative
, stated that "If 'chillaxing' was an Olympic sport then David Cameron, would win a gold medal", citing Cameron's fondness for relaxing. The biography stated that Cameron's "ability to separate his private life from his professional life is seen as an asset by some friends, and by others as a sign of complacency in the midst of a double dip recession."
[
450
]
Faith
At a Q&A in August 2013, Cameron described himself as a practising Christian and an active member of the
Church of England
.
[
451
]
On religious faith in general, he said: "I do think that organised religion can get things wrong but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society."
[
452
]
He said he considers the Bible "a sort of handy guide" on morality.
[
453
]
He viewed Britain as a "Christian country", and aimed to put faith back into politics.
