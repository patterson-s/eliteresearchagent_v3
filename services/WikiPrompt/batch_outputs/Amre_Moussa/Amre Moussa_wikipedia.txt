,
IPA:
[ˈʕɑmɾe
mæˈħæmmæd
ˈmuːsæ]
; born 3 October 1936) is an Egyptian
politician
and
diplomat
who was the
Secretary-General
of the
Arab League
, a 22-member forum representing
Arab states
, from 1 June 2001 to 1 July 2011. Previously he served in the government of
Egypt
as

committee
of 50 that will amend the
Egyptian constitution
.

Early life
[
edit
]
He was born on 3 October 1936 in
Cairo
,
Egypt
, the son of former parliamentarian Muhammad Moussa. His father also had a son named Pierre during his studies in France in the 1920s. However, Moussa's half-brother Pierre is a
French citizen
and has no

ties to Egypt.
[

]
Moussa finished his education after earning a degree in
law
from
Cairo University
in 1957.

Diplomatic career
[
edit
]
Moussa then began his
diplomatic career
between 1958 and 1972 he worked in several missions, including Egypt's Embassy in
Switzerland
and the Egyptian mission to the
United Nations
. From 1974 to 1977, he was an advisor to the
Minister of Foreign Affairs
. From 1977 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1990, he was the Director of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1981 to 1983, Moussa was the Deputy Permanent Representative to the
United Nations
in New York, then from 1983 to 1986 Ambassador to
India
.
[
4
]
In 1990, he was promoted Permanent Representative of Egypt to the
United Nations
. He was named
Minister of Foreign Affairs
by
Prime Minister
Atef Sedki
on 20 May 1991. He was minister until 15 May 2001 when he was elected as Secretary-General of the
Arab League
.
Moussa has been heavily involved with
Egypt's foreign policy
since 1958. He was Egypt's ambassador to the United Nations, India, and Switzerland for a total of 21 years. Moussa was one of the Arab and international diplomats who tried to resolve the
Lebanese Civil War
(1975–1990). After serving as Egypt's Foreign Minister from 1991 to 2001, he served as the Secretary General of the Arab League.
[
5
]
Moussa has been an extremely popular political figure in Egypt due to his criticism of Israeli policies towards Gaza and the West Bank.
[
6
]
In August 1994, Moussa made his first official visit to Israel—a visit marked by tension and controversy. Moussa drew criticism from Israeli commentators for declining to visit the
Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial
, a customary stop for visiting dignitaries, and for focusing his agenda entirely on pressing Israel to join the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT). At a joint press conference with Israeli Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres
, Moussa argued that
Israel’s nuclear capability
posed a threat to Egypt, while Peres responded by emphasizing Israel’s peaceful intentions and comparing the situation to the United States’ possession of nuclear weapons.
[
7
]
At the Forum for
new diplomacy
in February 2010, Moussa gave a speech in which he criticized the U.S. government's double standard supporting Israel's nuclear weapons policy

but not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear energy. He also criticized Western countries, including the U.S., for not recognizing the results of the
2006 Palestinian election
that brought
Hamas
into power.
[
8
]
Like
Mohamed El-Baradei
and the
Muslim Brotherhood
, he supports opening the
Gaza Strip
/Egypt border.
[
8
]
His criticisms have made Moussa extremely popular.

Secretary-General of the Arab League
[
edit
]
On 15 May 2001, Moussa was selected as Secretary-General of the
League of Arab States
and took office on 1 June 2001. Critics of former-
President
Hosni Mubarak
allege that Moussa's appointment to the office of Secretary-General of the Arab League was motivated by Mubarak's desire to remove him from the public spotlight, and so he would not compete as a candidate in the
2005 presidential elections
.

President of Italy
(Cairo, 27 October 2008).
On 2003, he became a member of the United Nations High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change for International Peace and Security.
[

On 2009, he signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Holy See
and met with
Pope Benedict XVI
in order to strengthen joint projects and to promote peace and dialogue on a cultural and political level.
[
9
]
On 13 June 2010, Moussa visited
Gaza
in a move to pressure Israel to lift its
economic blockade
over Hamas-ruled Gaza.
[
10
]
The visit by Moussa was the first by an official of the Arab League since the election of Hamas in 2007. Immediately after the
2010 Gaza flotilla raid
, Moussa said the Arab League would go to the
UN Security Council
to demand the blockade be lifted. On 15 May 2011,
Nabil Elaraby
was elected as Secretary-General of the Arab League and succeeded Moussa on 1 July 2011.

2005 presidential election
[

Main article:
2005 Egyptian presidential election
In 2004, an online community gathered tens of thousands of signatures petitioning for Moussa to run in the 2005 elections, but there was no response. In a
Doha Debate
Forum televised by the BBC in 2006,
[
12
]
Moussa was asked about his presidential hopes. Moussa merely replied that he hoped to continue the

recent run of successes that have occurred under his leadership at the Arab League until the end of his term.

2012 presidential election
[

Main article:
2012 Egyptian presidential election
Amr Moussa with
William Hague
(London, 25 May 2010).
When asked in October 2009 about rumours that he might run for the presidency in 2012, Moussa did not deny his intention to run for office or rule it out, leaving the door open to speculations. He argued that "It's the right of every citizen that has the capacity and efficiency to aspire to any political office that would allow him to contribute to the service of his nation".
[
13
]
He further stated to the press that the qualities required to be the President of Egypt also apply to
Gamal Mubarak
, son of Hosni Mubarak.
[
14
]
He also expressed appreciation "for the confidence expressed by many people when they talk about his candidacy for the presidency and that the message reached him".
[
15
]
Moussa during the
World Economic Forum
(Davos, 2013)
Moussa held talks with Mohamed El-Baradei after his return to Egypt. Many
[
who?
]
speculate that this meeting was held to discuss Constitutional reforms that will allow transparency in the election process as well as lifting restrictions on independent candidates. On 26 January 2011, at the Annual Horasis meeting in
Zürich
, Moussa shared strong views on the need for economic and political reforms in Egypt, and made it clear that he was considering a run.
[
16
]
On 1 February 2011, following the announcement by President Hosni Mubarak that he would not stand in the upcoming presidential elections, Moussa told CNN that he would seriously think about standing himself as a candidate in the next few weeks.
[
17
]
On the 8 February broadcast of
Al Jazeera
English's Empire, well-connected American journalist
Seymour Hersh
stated that Moussa was considered the U.S.'s favored "Plan B" should Mubarak resign, "whether he knows it or not."
[
18
]
On 11 February 2011, Al Jazeera English Online read from a Reuters report that stated Moussa was resigning from his position with the Arab League; on the day that President Mubarak resigned the presidency this furthered rumours he might make a strong bid for president when elections are announced in Egypt.
[

]
On 12

February 2011, the Egyptian daily newspaper
Alwafd
reported that a group of Egyptian youth met with Moussa to discuss a possible nomination for the presidential election. Moussa reportedly agreed to the nomination, but stated that he would await the currently proposed constitutional reforms.
[
19
]
Amr Moussa announced that he would be running as a presidential candidate on 1 March 2011.
[
20
]
A poll conducted during the 2011 protests asking "who do you think should be the next President of Egypt?" showed Moussa in the lead, with 26% of respondents naming him.
[
21
]
Moussa placed fifth in the election with 11.13% of the first round vote. After the election, he formed the
Conference Party
with which a number of smaller opposition parties aligned.
Criticisms
[
edit
]
Although credited with shaking up the Arab League's bureaucracy,
[
22
]
Moussa has been criticized by former and current staff members of the Arab League for his management of the organization. In his book,
The League of the Arab States: what’s left of it
, former Arab League and Syrian diplomat Kawkab Najib El Rayess accused Moussa of favoritism and promoting his loyalists into the high ranks of the Arab League at the expense of the more-qualified diplomats.
