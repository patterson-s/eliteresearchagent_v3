Early life and education
[
edit
]
Lieutenant Brent Scowcroft (seated second from left) with other members of the
82nd Squadron
at
Grenier Airfield
in 1948
Scowcroft was born March 19, 1925, in
Ogden, Utah
, the son of Lucile (née Ballantyne) and James Scowcroft, a grocer and business owner.
[
1
]
He was a descendant of early 19th-century British immigrants from England and Scotland, along with immigrants from
Denmark
and
Norway
. He elaborated upon his relationship with
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
in a 1999 oral history: "I have close personal ties to some of the church leadership. They would not consider me a good
Mormon
. I don't live by all of the rules the Mormons like—I like a glass of
wine
and a cup of
coffee
. But yes, I do consider myself a Mormon. It's part of a religious and a cultural heritage."
[

]
Scowcroft received his undergraduate degree and commission in the
United States Army Air Forces
from the
United States Military Academy
at
West Point, New York
, in June 1947. With the establishment of an independent
United States Air Force
in September 1947, his commission transferred to the USAF. Scowcroft subsequently earned an
MA
(1953) and
PhD
(1967) in
international relations
from
Columbia University
.

Nelson A. Rockefeller
(l) and Central Intelligence Agency Director
William Colby
(r) during a break in a meeting of
the National Security Council
in April 1975.
President
Gerald Ford
confers with
Henry Kissinger
and Scowcroft in October 1974.
Having envisioned life as a fighter pilot following
World War II
, Scowcroft completed his pilot training in October 1948 following his commissioning as an Air Force
Second Lieutenant
in 1947 and received his Air Force Command Pilot Wings.
[
4
]
However, on

January 6, 1949, while on flight training with a
North American P-51 Mustang
, his aircraft experienced engine trouble after taking-off from
Grenier Army Airfield
, causing the plane to crash-land. Although his injuries were not critical, Scowcroft assumed that he would never fly again and considered another career within the Air Force.
[
4
]
He served in a variety of operational and administrative positions from 1948 to 1953. In the course of his military career, he held positions at the
Joint Chiefs of Staff
, headquarters of the
United States Air Force
, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. His other assignments included: faculty positions at the
United States Air Force Academy
and the
United States Military Academy
, and
Assistant Air Attaché
in the
American Embassy
in
Belgrade
,
Yugoslavia
.
[

]
As a senior officer, General Scowcroft was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, and served in the Long Range Planning Division, Directorate of Doctrine, Concepts and Objectives from 1964 to 1966. He next attended the
National War College
at
Fort McNair
, followed by assignment in July 1968 to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In September 1969, he was reassigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the Directorate of Plans as Deputy Assistant for National Security Council Matters. In March 1970 he joined the
Joint Chiefs of Staff
organization and became the Special Assistant to the Director of the Joint Staff.

He was promoted to

lieutenant general
on August 16, 1974, and retired from active duty at that rank on December 1, 1975. He had, just a month earlier, during the
Halloween Massacre
, become the
United States National Security Advisor
(for him, the first time), replacing
Henry Kissinger
.
[

[

Scowcroft's continued service in the Air Force would have been contingent on reconfirmation of his rank by the Senate, a distinction that National Security Advisor
H. R. McMaster
elected to pursue in 2018.
[

His military decorations and awards included the
Air Force Distinguished Service Medal
, the
Legion of Merit
with oak leaf cluster and the

.
[

On the 24th anniversary of the
USS
Liberty
incident
(in 1991), approximately 50
Liberty
survivors, including Captain
William McGonagle
, were invited to the
White House
to meet with President
George H.W. Bush
in a meeting set up by former Congressmen
Paul Findley
and
Pete McCloskey
.
[

]
[
11
]
After waiting for over 2 hours, President Bush waved at them as he passed by in his limousine, but did not meet with them in person.
[
12
]
[
11
]
Many of the survivors were reportedly disheartened and disappointed with this.
[
11
]
Instead, Scowcroft and White House Chief of Staff
John H. Sununu
greeted them.
[

[

[

Rear Admiral
Thomas A. Brooks
, who had spoken out in favor of
Liberty
survivors previously, presented them with a
Presidential Unit Citation
that had been signed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson
but never awarded.
[

]
[
13
]
Former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Admiral
Thomas H. Moorer
, a longtime
Liberty
advocate, was also in attendance.
[

]
[

]
This meeting was objected to by the
Anti-Defamation League
.
[

]
[
15
]
Before joining the Bush administration, Scowcroft was vice chairman of
Kissinger Associates
. He had a long association with
Henry Kissinger
, having served as his assistant when Kissinger was the National Security Adviser under
Richard Nixon
, from 1969.
[
16
]
Scowcroft was long sought after as a respected, professional and largely apolitical or nonpartisan expert (within the standards of fellow White House veterans) and chaired and served on a number of policy advisory councils,

including the President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control, the President's Commission on Strategic Forces, the
President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management
, the
Defense Policy Board
, and the President's Special Review Board (
Tower Commission
) investigating the
Iran–Contra affair
. He also served on the Guiding Coalition of the nonpartisan
Project on National Security Reform
. He was appointed Co-Chair of the
Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future
from 2010 to 2012 alongside
Lee Hamilton
.
[
17
]
On the morning of
September 11, 2001
, Scowcroft was in an
E-4B
aircraft, also known as the National Airborne Operations Command Center (NAOC), on the taxiway, waiting to takeoff for
Offutt Air Force Base
, when the first hijacked airliner hit the
World Trade Center
(WTC). Scowcroft's aircraft was en route to Offutt when the second hijacked airliner struck the WTC. Scowcroft was involved in observing the command and control operations of both President
George W. Bush
in
Florida
, and Vice President
Dick Cheney
, who was at the
White House
.
[
18
]
Scowcroft was the founder and president of
The Forum for International Policy
, a
think tank
. He was also president of The Scowcroft Group, an international
business consulting
firm. He was co-chair, along with
Joseph Nye
, of the
Aspen Strategy Group
. He was a member of the
Inter-American Dialogue
,
Trilateral Commission
, and the
Council on Foreign Relations
and a board member of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies
and the
Atlantic Council
.
[
19
]
Scowcroft was a leading
Republican
critic of American policy towards
Iraq
before and after the
2003 invasion
, which war critics in particular have seen as significant given Scowcroft's close ties to former President George H. W. Bush.
[
20
]
[
21
]
[
22
]
[
23
]
He drew attention for reports of remarks critical of Bush – which he did not deny when reported by
The Washington Post
citing his view that "Bush is 'mesmerized' by Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon
, that
Iraq
was a 'failing venture' and that the administration's unilateralist approach has harmed
relations between Europe and the United States
."
[

]
Despite his public criticism of the decision to invade, Scowcroft continued to describe himself as "a friend" of the Bush administration.
[
24
]
He

also strongly opposed a precipitous withdrawal, arguing that a pull-out from Iraq before the country was able to govern, sustain, and defend itself "would be a strategic defeat for American interests, with potentially catastrophic consequences both in the region and beyond".
[
25
]
Scowcroft went on to stress that the U.S. must "secure the support of the countries of the region themselves. It is greatly in their self-interest to give that support.. unfortunately, in recent years they have come to see it as dangerous to identify with the United States, and so they have largely stood on the sidelines." The New York Times noted that Scowcroft was "a traditionalist, who believed that the nation should work with allies and international organizations, as opposed to a 'transformationalist,' like the second President Bush, who argued that America should fight terrorism by spreading democracy in the world."

as a "direct response" to
9/11
terrorism, a
war
that would go on to last about 20 years.
[

President
George H. W. Bush
presented him with the
Presidential Medal of Freedom
in 1991. In 1993, he was created an Honorary
Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire
by
Queen Elizabeth II
at
Buckingham Palace
. In 1988, he received the Golden Plate Award of the
American Academy of Achievement
.
[
28
]
In 2005, Scowcroft was awarded the
William Oliver Baker
Award by the
Intelligence and National Security Alliance
.
[
29
]
In 1998, he co-wrote
A World Transformed
with George H. W. Bush. This book described what it was like to be in the
White House
during the end of the
Cold War
, as the
Soviet Union
collapsed in the early 1990s. Notably, both figures explained why they didn't go on to
Baghdad
in 1991: "Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."
[
30
]
In 1994, Scowcroft co-authored the opinion-editorial "The Time for Temporizing is Over" urging President
Bill Clinton
to order a
preemptive strike
on
North Korea
's
Yongbyon nuclear facility
unless it readmitted
International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors.
[
31
]
His discussions of foreign policy with
Zbigniew Brzezinski
,

led by journalist
David Ignatius
, were published in a 2008 book titled
America and the World: Conversations on the Future of American Foreign Policy
.
[
32
]
Scowcroft was a member of the Honorary Council of Advisors for
U.S.-Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce
(USACC).
[
33
]
Critics have suggested that Scowcroft was unethical in his lobbying for the Turkish and Azeri governments because of his ties to
Lockheed Martin
and other defense contractors that do significant business with
Turkey
.
[
34
]
He was also a member of the board of directors of the
International Republican Institute
,
[
35
]
and served on the Advisory Board for
Columbia University
's
School of International and Public Affairs
[
36
]
and for America Abroad Media.
[
37
]
Scowcroft endorsed
Hillary Clinton
in the run-up for the
2016 United States presidential election
.
[
38
]
In 1989, he was sent to Beijing, China following the Tiananmen Square massacre by President George H.W. Bush for a sensitive China-related mission.
[
39
]
Evaluation
[
edit
]
Scholarly evaluations of Scowcroft's performance have been generally favorable. For example
Ivo Daalder
and I. M. Destler  quoting other scholars, conclude:
"Brent Scowcroft was in many ways the ideal national security adviser—indeed, he offers a model for how the job should be done." His "winning formula" consisted of gaining the trust of the key principals of U.S. foreign policymaking, establishing "a cooperative policy process at all levels," one both transparent and collegial, and keeping an "unbreakable relationship with the president," thanks to their close friendship and mutual respect. The result was that Scowcroft "proved to be an extraordinarily effective national security adviser" in comparison with others who have held the office, particularly in light of the difficult and transformative period in which he held office.
[
40
]
Other evaluations from colleagues and national security veterans in both parties echo similar points.
In a largely laudatory obituary, T
he New York Times
noted "his appeal for public service was a classic reminder of a less partisan age, when presidents often reached out to experienced talent, regardless of party loyalties."
The
Atlantic Council
provided an assessment, with quotes from several experts after Scowcroft's death, that noted "Looking back on his time working with Scowcroft in the Nixon administration, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger explained that 'in a period when America

was tearing itself apart,' Scowcroft’s 'steadiness had a calming influence then as did his faith in his country’s ultimate purposes.' Former US Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates
argued that what 'set Brent apart as National Security Advisor was that he played fair…he did not take advantage of his close relationship with the president to disadvantage others.'
John Deutch
, former Director of Central Intelligence, recalled that “Brent had the ideal temperament to lead the country. He was smart, deceptively articulate with a calm demeanor that often masked his strategic thinking.'"
[
41
]
Scowcroft award
[
edit
]
Scowcroft was the inspiration and namesake for a special presidential award begun under the
George H. W. Bush
administration. According to Gates, the award is given to the official "who most ostentatiously falls asleep in a meeting with the president". According to Gates, the president "evaluated candidates on three criteria. First, duration—how long did they sleep? Second, the depth of the sleep. Snoring always got you extra points. And third, the quality of recovery. Did one just quietly open one's eyes and return to the meeting, or did you jolt awake and maybe spill something hot in the process?"
[
42
]
According to Bush himself, the award "gives extra points for he/she who totally craters, eyes tightly closed, in the midst of meetings, but in fairness a lot of credit is given for sleeping soundly while all about you are doing their thing."
[
43
]
Scowcroft had gained a reputation for doing such things to the extent that it became a
running gag
.
[
44
]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Scowcroft married Marian Horner in 1951. His wife, a
Pennsylvania
native, was trained as a nurse at St. Francis School of Nursing in Pittsburgh and graduated from Columbia University. They had one daughter, Karen Scowcroft. Marian Horner Scowcroft, a
diabetic
, died on July 17, 1995, at
George Washington University Hospital
.
[
45
]
In March 1993, when Scowcroft was given an honorary
KBE
by Queen Elizabeth II, his daughter was also received by the Queen.
[
46
]
Death
[
edit
]
On August 6, 2020, Scowcroft died at his home in
Falls Church, Virginia
, at age 95.

On January 29, 2021, Scowcroft is buried at
