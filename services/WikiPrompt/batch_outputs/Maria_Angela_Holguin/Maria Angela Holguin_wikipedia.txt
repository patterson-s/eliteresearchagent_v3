Signature
María Ángela Holguín Cuéllar
(born 13 November 1963) is a Colombian politician and diplomat who has been serving as
United Nations Secretary-General
António Guterres
’ Personal Envoy on Cyprus since 2024.
[

]
Holguín served as the
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia
from 2010 to 2018. She has also served as the 25th
Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations
, and as Ambassador of Colombia to Venezuela.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
María Ángela Holguín Cuéllar was born on 13 November 1963 to Julio Holguín Umaña and Lucila Cuéllar Calderón.
[
2
]
She is related to
Carlos
and
Jorge Holguín Mallarino
, briefly appointed as interim presidents of Colombia in the presidential periods of 1888–1892 and 1921–1922 respectively.
Holguín studied at the Gimnasio Femenino school in Bogota, and then studied
French
at

the
Université Paris X
. She graduated from the
University of the Andes
in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in
political science
, and she also completed a specialization there in public management and administrative institutions in 1992.
Diplomatic career
[
edit
]
In 2010, while Holguín was serving as Colombia's Representative to
CAF – Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean
in
Buenos Aires
, the then president-elect
Juan Manuel Santos Calderón
nominated her to head the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
. Holguín's nomination was hailed as a wise political move given the diplomatic problems in the region following the
2008 Andean diplomatic crisis
. Holguín's ambassadorship in Venezuela was overall seen as the tacit endorsement that enabled her to tackle the diplomatic
détente
between the sister nations, while her work with
CAF
signalled Santos' desire to strengthen ties with the rest of the continent.
Before having taken office, Holguín accompanied president-elect Santos on his first overseas trip after being elected, taking the diplomatic role head on during their meetings with
British Prime Minister
David Cameron
and
German Chancellor
Angela Merkel
.
[

]
Holguín as Chancellor-designate also headed talks with Venezuelan Chancellor
Nicolás Maduro
that spearheaded the renewal of diplomatic ties with the neighbouring nation, which were later formalised in a meeting held in
Santa Marta
between the two Presidents.
[

]
Holguín then travelled to
Ecuador
to meet with Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño to convince
Quito
to renew diplomatic ties and to personally invite President
Rafael Correa
to attend the inauguration,
[

]
a feat she managed even though Ecuador had an arrest warrant for Santos for his actions as
Minister of National Defence of Colombia
.
