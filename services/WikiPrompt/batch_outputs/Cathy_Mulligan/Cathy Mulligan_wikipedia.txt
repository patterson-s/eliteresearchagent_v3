Early life and background
[
edit
]
Carey Hannah Mulligan
[
1
]
was born on 28 May 1985 in London,
[
2
]
to Nano (née Booth) and Stephen Mulligan. Her father, a hotel manager, is of Irish descent and is originally from
Liverpool
.
[

]
Her mother, a university lecturer, is from
Llandeilo
, Wales.
[
4
]
[

]
[
5
]
[
6
]
Her parents met while they were both working in a hotel in their twenties.  In the television series
My Grandparents' War
(2019), Mulligan explored her maternal grandfather Denzil Booth's role as naval radar artillery officer on
HMS
Indefatigable
at the
Battle of Okinawa
and then sailing into
Tokyo Bay
at the end of
World War II
.
[

]
When Mulligan was three, her father's work as a hotel manager took the family to
West Germany
. While living there, she and her brother attended the
International School of Düsseldorf
.
[
8
]
When she was eight, she and her family moved back to the UK. As a teenager, she was educated at
Woldingham School
, an independent school in
Surrey
.
[
9
]
Her interest in acting sparked from watching her brother perform in a school production of
The King and I
when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus.
[
10
]
While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions.
[
11
]
[
12
]
When she was 16, she attended a production starring
Kenneth Branagh
. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief

that she wanted to pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," she said. Branagh's sister replied: "Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress."
[
10
]
Mulligan's parents disapproved of her acting ambitions and wished for her to attend a university like her brother. At age 17, she applied to three London drama schools instead of the universities she was expected to apply to, but was not invited to attend them.
[
10
]
During her final year at Woldingham School, screenwriter
Julian Fellowes
delivered a lecture at the school on the production of the film
Gosford Park
. Mulligan briefly talked to him after the lecture and asked him for advice on an acting career. Fellowes tried to dissuade her from the profession and suggested she "marry a lawyer" instead. Undeterred, she later sent Fellowes a letter in which she stated she was serious about acting and that it was her purpose in life. Several weeks later, Fellowes's wife Emma invited Mulligan to a dinner she and her husband were hosting for young aspiring actors. It facilitated an introduction between Mulligan and a casting assistant that led to an audition for a role in
Pride & Prejudice
. She auditioned three times, and was eventually given the role of Kitty Bennet.
