Anna Gunilla Carlsson
(born 11 May 1963) is a
Swedish
politician
and a member of the
Moderate Party
. She served as
Minister for International Development Cooperation
from 2006 to 2013,
member
of the
Swedish Riksdag
from 2002 to 2013 and deputy chairman of her party from 2003 to 2015.
Early life
[
edit
]
Carlsson was born and raised in
Lund
in
Skåne
. She was at one time chairperson of the
Moderate Youth League
district in that county. At the
Battle of Lycksele
, when current party leader
Fredrik Reinfeldt
was elected chairman of the Youth League, Carlsson was elected vice chairman.
Political career
[
edit
]
Member of the European Parliament, 1995-2002
[
edit
]
After working as an
auditor
, Carlsson joined the Moderate Party office in 1994. In
1995
, she was elected to the
European Parliament
and served until 2002. In parliament, she served on the
Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy
(1995-1999) and on the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy
(1999-2002). In addition to her committee assignments, she was vice-chair

of the parliament's delegation to the
European Economic Area
Joint Parliamentary Committee (EEA) from 1995 until 1997.
Career in national politics
[
edit
]
In the
2002 national elections
, Carlsson was elected to the Riksdag for
Stockholm
. In 1999, she was elected vice chairman of the Moderate Party.
With the growing co-operation between the Swedish opposition parties, Carlsson was appointed to head the group co-ordinating
foreign policy
. This led to speculation about her being a possible candidate to the office of
Minister for Foreign Affairs
after
Alliance for Sweden
's victory in the
2006 election
. With a number of the Moderate Party Riksdag members from Östergötland resigning, she decided to stand in her home county in 2006. While she won the internal primaries, she was only placed second on the list after
Gunnar Axén
, but comfortably reached re-election as the party went from three to four seats from the county.
[

]
She continues to make her home in
Tyresö
outside Stockholm.
From 2007, Carlsson was a member of the
World Bank Group
’s High Level Advisory Council on Women's Economic Empowerment, which was chaired by Danny Leipziger and
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul
.
[

In her capacity as minister, Carlsson also chaired the Stockholm-based Commission on Climate Change and Development (CCCD), a body made up of 13 international experts and established by the Swedish government in 2007 with the aim of looking at how countries can adapt to climate change. In its final report, the commission recommended in 2009 that poor countries already suffering from the impact of climate change urgently need up to $2 billion to help adjust and cope.
[

In September 2009, Carlsson led, together with
Karel De Gucht
,
European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection
, a delegation to Zimbabwe for discussions with President
Robert Mugabe
. This was to discuss the lifting of targeted EU sanctions against him and more than 200 of his political allies and related businesses. He and his Zanu-PF party have for years loudly argued that these measures are directly responsible for Zimbabwe's economic collapse. The EU team did not buy that argument, and would not even put the sanctions issue on the negotiating table at that time, according to a
BBC
report.

As the
Swedish Riksdag
convened after the summer on 17 September

2013,
Prime Minister
Fredrik Reinfeldt
announced that Carlsson had submitted her resignation and he had accepted the resignation earlier that morning.
[

Subsequently, she resigned her seat in the
Swedish Riksdag
.

Career in international development
[
edit
]
In her final year as minister from 2012 until 2013, Carlsson served – alongside
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf
,
David Cameron
and others – on the
High-level Panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda
, an advisory board established by
United Nations Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon
to develop the global development agenda beyond 2015, the target date for the
Millennium Development Goals
.
[

]
Following her resignation, Carlsson served alongside
Tertius Zongo
and Callisto Madavo on the
African Development Bank
’s three-member High Level Panel on Fragile States between 2013 and 2014, where she advised on strategies related to the
Horn of Africa
.
[
9
]
Between 2013 and 2015, she was a member of the
UNAIDS
–
Lancet
Commission on Defeating AIDS, chaired by
Joyce Banda
,
Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma
and
Peter Piot
.
[
10
]
In 2017,
United Nations Secretary-General
António Guterres
appointed Carlsson as the UNAIDS deputy executive director, management and governance, and
Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nation
.
[
11
]
Following
Michel Sidibé
’s resignation, she briefly served as executive director ad interim from May until August 2019.
[
12

[
