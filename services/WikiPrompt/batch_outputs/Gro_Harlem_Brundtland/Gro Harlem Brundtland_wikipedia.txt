,
[

]
who served three terms as the
prime minister of Norway
(1981, 1986–1989,

and 1990–1996), as the leader of her party from 1981 to 1992, and as the
director-general
of the
World Health Organization
from 1998 to 2003. She is also known for having chaired the
Brundtland Commission
which presented the
Brundtland Report
on
sustainable development
.
Educated as a physician, Brundtland joined the Labour Party and entered the government in 1974 as
Minister of the Environment
. She became the first female prime minister of Norway
[
1
]
on 4 February 1981, but left office on 14 October 1981; she returned as prime minister on 9 May 1986 and served until 16 October 1989. She finally returned for her third term on 3 November 1990. After her surprise resignation as prime minister in 1996, she became an international leader in

special envoy on Climate Change
from 2007 to 2010.
[
2
]
She is also deputy chair of
The Elders
and a former vice-president of
Socialist International
.
Brundtland belonged to the moderate wing of her party and supported Norwegian membership in the
European Union
during the
1994 referendum
. As prime minister, Brundtland became widely known as the "mother of the nation".
[
3
]
Brundtland received the 1994
Charlemagne Prize
, and has received many other awards and recognitions.
Early life
[
edit
]
Brundtland was born in
Oslo
in 1939, the daughter of physician and politician
Gudmund Harlem
and Inga Margareta Elisabet Brynolf (1918–2005). She has a younger brother, Lars and a younger sister,
Hanne
.
In 1963, Brundtland graduated with a medical degree, a
cand.med.
from the
University of Oslo
. She took her master's degree at
Harvard University
in 1965, as a
Master of Public Health
.
From 1966 to 1969, she worked as a physician at the
Directorate of Health
(
Helsedirektoratet
), and from 1969 she worked as a doctor in Oslo's public school health service.
Political career
[
edit
]
She was
minister for environmental affairs
from 1974 to 1979.
Prime minister of Norway
[
edit
]
Brundtland became Norway's first female
prime minister
in 1981.
[
4
]
She served as prime minister from February to October.
[
5
]
At 41 years old she was the youngest person to become Prime Minister of Norway.
Brundtland served as prime minister for two further, and

more durable, terms. The second ministry was from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989 and this cabinet became known worldwide for its high proportion of female ministers: nearly half, or eight of the total eighteen ministers, were female. The third ministry was from 3 November 1990 to 25 October 1996.
Brundtland became leader of the Labour Party in 1981 and held the office until resigning in 1992, during her third term as prime minister. In 1996, she resigned from office and retired completely from politics. Her successor as both Labour Party leader in 1992 and as prime minister in 1996 was
Thorbjørn Jagland
.
Local politics
[
edit
]
Brundtland returned to politics when she became a candidate to the
Oslo City Council
for the
2023 local elections
. She ultimately won a seat in the council.
[

]
[
7
]
International career
[
edit
]
In 1983, Brundtland was invited by then
United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Pérez de Cuéllar
to establish and chair the
World Commission on Environment and Development
(WCED), widely referred to as the
Brundtland Commission
. She developed the broad political concept of
sustainable development
in the course of extensive public hearings, that were distinguished by their inclusiveness. The commission, which published its report,
Our Common Future
, in April 1987, provided the momentum for the 1992
Earth Summit
/
UNCED
, which was headed by
Maurice Strong
, who had been a prominent member of the commission. The Brundtland Commission also provided momentum for
Agenda 21
.
During her third ministry, the Norwegian government in 1993 took the initiative to sponsor secret peace talks between the Government of Israel led by
Yitzchak Rabin
– like Brundtland, leader of a Labour Party – and the PLO led by
Yasser Arafat
. This culminated with the signing of the
Oslo Accords
. For several years afterwards, Norway continued to have a high-profile involvement in promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace, though increasingly displaced by the United States from its role as the mediator.
After the end of her term as PM, Brundtland was then elected Director-General of the
World Health Organization
in May 1998. In this capacity, Brundtland adopted a far-reaching approach to public health, establishing a Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, chaired by
Jeffrey Sachs
, and addressing
violence
as a major public health issue. Brundtland spearheaded the movement, now worldwide, to achieve the abolition of

cigarette smoking
by education, persuasion, and increased taxation.
[
8
]
Under her leadership, the World Health Organization was one of the first major employers to make quitting smoking a condition of employment.
Under Brundtland's leadership, the World Health Organization was criticized
[
9
]
for increased drug-company influence on the agency.
Brundtland was recognized in 2003 by
Scientific American
as their 'Policy Leader of the Year' for coordinating a rapid worldwide response to stem outbreaks of
SARS
. Brundtland was succeeded on 21 July 2003 by
Jong-Wook Lee
. In 1994, Brundtland was awarded the
Charlemagne Prize
of the city of
Aachen
.
In 2006 Brundtland was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons who reviewed the work of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD). In May 2007, UN Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon
named Brundtland, as well as
Ricardo Lagos
(the former
president of Chile
), and
Han Seung-soo
(the former foreign minister of
South Korea
), to serve as UN Special Envoys for Climate Change.
[

Brundtland's hallmark political activities have been chronicled by her husband,
Arne Olav Brundtland
[

, in his two bestsellers,
Married to Gro
(
ISBN
82-516-1647-6

[
12
]
Brundtland is also a member of the
Club of Madrid
, an independent organization of former leaders of democratic states, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.
[
13
]
Brundtland is a founding member of
The Elders
, a group of world leaders originally convened by
Nelson Mandela
,
Graça Machel
and
Desmond Tutu
in order to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the launch of the group on 18 July 2007 in
Johannesburg
, South Africa. Brundtland has been active in The Elders' work, participating in a broad range of the group's initiatives. She has travelled with Elders delegations to
Cyprus
, the
Korean Peninsula
,
Ethiopia
, India and the
Middle East
. Brundtland

has also been involved in The Elders' initiative on
child marriage
, including the founding of
Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage
.
[

Assassination attempt
[
edit
]
Harlem Brundtland speaking at
Fronteiras do Pensamento
in 2014
Brundtland narrowly escaped
assassination
by
Anders Behring Breivik
on
22 July 2011
. She had been on the island of
Utøya
hours before the
massacre there
to give a speech to the
AUF
camp; Breivik stated that he originally intended Brundtland to be the main target of the attack (along with
Eskil Pedersen
and
Jonas Gahr Støre
), but he had been delayed while travelling from Oslo.
[
18
]
[
19
]
Breivik arrived on Utøya about two hours after Brundtland had left.
During
his trial
in 2012, Breivik revealed detailed assassination plans for Brundtland.
[
20
]
He told the court that he had planned to handcuff her and then record himself reading out a prepared text detailing her "crimes", before decapitating her on camera using a
bayonet
and uploading the footage to the internet. Breivik said that while Brundtland had been his main target, he had still planned to massacre everyone else on the island.
[
21
]
Personal life
[
edit
]
She married Arne Olav Brundtland on 9 December 1960. They had four children; one is deceased. They own a house in the
south of France
.
[
22
]
Health issues
[
edit
]
Brundtland was operated on for
uterine cancer
in 2002 at
Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål
.
[
23
]
In 2008 it became known that during 2007 she had received two treatments at Ullevål, paid for by Norwegian public expenditures. Since she had previously notified the Norwegian authorities that she had changed residence to France, she was no longer entitled to Norwegian
social security
benefits. Following media attention surrounding the matter, Brundtland decided to change residence once more, back to Norway, and she also announced that she would be paying for the treatments herself.
[
24

]
Brundtland has claimed to suffer from
electrical sensitivity
which causes headaches when someone uses a mobile phone near her.
[
