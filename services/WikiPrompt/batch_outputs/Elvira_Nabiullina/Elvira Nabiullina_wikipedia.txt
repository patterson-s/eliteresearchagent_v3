Early life and education
[
edit
]
Nabiullina was born in
Ufa
,
Bashkir ASSR
, on 29 October 1963
[
5
]
into an ethnic
Tatar
family.
[
6
]
[
7
]
Her father, Sakhipzada Saitzadayevich, was a driver, while her mother, Zuleikha Khamatnurovna, was a factory manager. Nabiullina graduated from school No. 31 of Ufa,

followed by the
Moscow State University Faculty of Economics
in 1986.
[
8
]
[
9
]
In subsequent years, she was selected for the 2007
Yale World Fellows
program.
[
10
]
Career
[
edit
]
Between 1991 and 1994, Nabiullina worked at the
USSR
Science and Industry Union and its successor, the
Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs
.
[
8
]
In 1994, she moved to the Ministry for Economic Development and Trade, where she rose to the level of deputy minister by 1997; she left the ministry in 1998.
[
8
]
She spent the next two years with
Sberbank
as its chief executive and with former Economic Development and Trade Minister
German Gref
's non-governmental
think tank
, the Center for Strategic Development, before returning to the Ministry for Economic Development and Trade as first deputy in 2000.
[
8
]
Between 2003 and her September 2007 appointment as minister, she chaired the Center for Strategic Development as well as an advisory committee preparing for Russia's 2006 presidency of the
G8
.

at his funeral on 8 April 2022
Russian President Putin appointed Nabiullina to the post of minister of economic development and trade on 24 September 2007, replacing Gref.
[
1
]
She found working with then-deputy premier and finance minister
Alexei Kudrin
"difficult but always interesting"
[
11
]
and remained in that position until 21 May 2012.
[
2
]
In 2012 she was one of six senior government figures to accompany Putin back to the
Kremlin administration
after Putin was elected
president of Russia
for a third term. From May 2012 to June 2013, she served as Assistant to President Putin for Economic Affairs.
[
12
]
Succeeding
Sergey Ignatyev
in 2013, Nabiullina was appointed head of the
Central Bank of Russia
, becoming the second woman after
Tatiana Paramonova
[
b
]
to hold that position, and thus the first Russian woman in the G8.
[
17
]
In May 2014 she was named one of the world's most powerful women by
Forbes
, which noted that she "has been given the difficult task of

managing the
ruble
exchange rate during
Russian military operation
in
Ukraine
and
annexation of Crimea
and facilitating growth for an economy trying to avoid a recession".
[
17
]
In an effort to stop the ruble's slide, the Central Bank of Russia, under her leadership, hiked interest rates, free-floated the exchange rate, and kept a cap on inflation,
[
18
]
thus stabilizing the financial system and boosting foreign-investor confidence.
[
19
]
Euromoney
magazine named her their 2015 Central Bank Governor of the Year.
[
20
]
In 2017, the British magazine
The Banker
chose Nabiullina as "Central Banker of the Year, Europe".
[
21
]
On 28 February 2022, she gave a speech announcing a number of measures to combat the
2022 Russian financial crisis
caused by the
Russian invasion of Ukraine
, including that the Central Bank of Russia's
interest rate
would rise to 20%, that the
stock market
be closed, and that
capital controls
would be instituted.
[
22
]
In March 2022, it was reported that she had attempted to resign her position, only to be ordered to stay in post by Putin.
[
23
]
In September 2022, the
United States Treasury Department
sanctioned Nabiullina.
[
24
]
"Nabiullina's brooch"
[
edit
]
There is a belief in the
Russian media
that the head of the Central Bank uses
brooches
at public events to signal the state of the economy and the regulator's plans. In 2020, Nabiullina appeared at press conferences with a brooch of a blue wave, a dot, a
tumbler
, a
stork
. In March 2021, when the increase in the refinancing rate was announced for the first time in three years, she appeared with a
hawk
.
[
25
]
In September 2021, Nabiullina revealed the meaning of the brooches, which represent her own way of communication, an alternate language to "give the market a chance to reflect". Meanwhile, according to Nabiullina, the exact significance of any brooch should remain mysterious and is with rare exceptions ambiguous.
[
26
]
In her speech on 28 February 2022 announcing measures to alleviate the 2022 Russian financial crisis she wore black attire and no brooch.
Sergei Guriev
of
Sciences Po
speculated that it "should not be read as she disagreed with Putin's policy, but as a sign that it is time to bury normal
monetary policy
," while adding that "I am

sure she was not part of the narrow circle making the decision on going to war."
[
22
]
Personal life
[
edit
]
In the late 1980s while studying at the graduate school of Moscow State University, Nabiullina married a lecturer there,
Yaroslav Kuzminov
. Kuzminov became rector of
National Research University Higher School of Economics
(1994-2021), since July 2021 the academic supervisor of the HSE. They have a son, Vasiliy (born 13 August 1988), at present a Research Fellow at the HSE.

Australia

[
27

Russian annexation of southern and eastern Ukraine
, she was sanctioned by the
United States
.
[

She was also sanctioned by
Canada
,

New Zealand

and the

Tatyana Vladimirovna Paramonova
(
Russian
:
Татьяна Владимировна Парамонова
; born 24 October 1950
Moscow
,
Soviet Union
), who had been first deputy of the Central Bank since 1992, became the acting head of the Central Bank of Russia on 15 October 1994 after
Viktor Gerashchenko
resigned following the events on 11 October 1994 known as "
Black Tuesday
". On 2 December 1994 during her tenure, law enforcement raided Most-Bank. In late April 1995,
Vladimir Vinogradov
was very critical of Paramonova's leadership of the Central Bank and, subsequently, the Duma never approved her as the governor of the Bank of Russia. On 24 August 1995 or "
Black Thursday
", the Moscow market for interbank loans collapsed which became the basis for Paramonova stepping down as acting head of the Central Bank on 8 November 1995.
Sergei Konstantinovich Dubinin
(
Russian
:
Сергей Константинович Дубинин
; born 10 December 1950
Moscow
,
Soviet Union
), who was the former deputy chairman of the board of
Imperial Bank
which was led by
Sergey Rodionov
and focused on oil and natural gas supplies to East Germany and later to Germany including the oil-for-pipes program, replaced Paramonova and was approved by the Duma on 22 November 1995 to be the governor of the Central

Bank of Russia. Previously, Sergey Dubinin had been the acting finance minister of Russia from January 1994 until October 1994 when he was fired following the events of "
Black Tuesday
".
