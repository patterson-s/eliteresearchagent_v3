(CVP/PDC), she was elected as
President of the Swiss Confederation
for 2010 and 2017. Leuthard headed the
Federal Department of Economic Affairs
until 2010, when she became head of the
Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications

Biography
[
edit

]
Leuthard was a member of the
Swiss National Council
from 1999 to 2006 for the
canton of Aargau
. She presided over the
Christian Democratic People's Party
from 2004 to 2006.
[

]
Following the resignation of
Joseph Deiss
from the
Swiss Federal Council
, Leuthard was elected as his successor on 14 June 2006. She received 133 out of 234 valid votes to become the 109th Federal Councillor. She is the fifth woman elected to the Federal Council. Her election represented a departure from a long precedent of replacing a Member of the Federal Council with someone from the same language group. While Deiss was a French speaker, Leuthard is a German speaker.

2017 Swiss Federal Council
From 1 August 2006 until 31 October 2010, she was head of the
Federal Department of Economic Affairs
. On 1 November 2010 she became head of the
Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications
, succeeding
Moritz Leuenberger
. For the calendar year 2009, Leuthard was elected Vice President of the Swiss Confederation, virtually assuring her election as
President of the Confederation
for the calendar year 2010. Due to a large amount of turnover on the Federal Council in recent years, she was the longest-serving Federal Councillor not to have served as the body's president.
She was elected
President of the Confederation
for 2010 and 2017.

She became the third woman to hold the post, after
Ruth Dreifuss
(1999) and
Micheline Calmy-Rey
(2007).
[

]
As President of the Confederation, Leuthard presided over meetings of the Federal Council and carried out representative functions that would normally be handled by a
head of state
in other democracies (though in Switzerland, the Federal Council as a whole is regarded as the head of state). She was also the highest-ranking official in the
Swiss order of precedence
and had the power to act on behalf of the whole Federal Council in emergency situations. However, in most cases, Leuthard was merely
primus inter pares
, with no power above and beyond her six colleagues.
She was succeeded by Calmy-Rey in 2011, the first time two women held the office in succession. Following a reshuffle of portfolios after the
by-election of two new Federal Councillors in 2010
, Leuthard replaced outgoing
Moritz Leuenberger
at the head of

the
Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications
.
[

]
In her capacity as minister, she was appointed by
United Nations Secretary General
António Guterres
in 2018 to the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, co-chaired by
Melinda Gates
and
Jack Ma
.

The project
SAFFA 2020
is under the patronage of the three Federal Councillors: Leuthard,
Simonetta Sommaruga
and
Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf
, as well as by the former Federal Councillor Calmy-Rey.

In July 2022,
Swiss media
reported that Doris Leuthard was the victim of aggression by her husband in their vacation home in
Ticino
with a knife. Her husband has been detained in a
psychiatric prison
by the
Swiss police
because of the chance of recidivism and
alcoholism
.
