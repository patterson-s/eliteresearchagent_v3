Family roots
[
edit
]
The Michel family comes from the Flemish town
Hoegaarden
, just across the 1963 official linguistic border and the frontier between the present (since 1994
[
1
]
) provinces of
Flemish Brabant
and
Walloon Brabant
. There, it has been nicknamed from the 19th century onward as the ‘Sellekes’. Louis Michel "went to school in Hoegaarden and still speaks perfectly the local dialect". His family moved from Hoegaarden to
Zétrud-Lumay
in 1955.

Brussels
.

In July 2004, the

government appointed Michel as its candidate for the Belgian seat on the European Commission led by
José Manuel Durão Barroso
, to replace former commissioner
Philippe Busquin
. He was nominated on 12 August 2004 to become EU commissioner starting in November 2004.
As part of a political agreement, Busquin resigned early in September 2004 to give Louis Michel an early opportunity to serve on the European Commission. Michel completed Busquin's term as the European Commissioner for Science and Research and then served as the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and

Development.
He is also the mayor of the municipality of
Jodoigne
in

The Democratic Republic of the Congo dossier
[
edit
]
Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, Ali Mohammed Ghedi, and Louis Michel (28-03-2006)
Michel has been interested in the Central Africa situation and busy with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo
dossier since he became Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs (1999–2004) and European Commissioner in charge of the Development & Humanitarian Aid in the
Barroso Commission
.
Congo was a Belgian colony between 1908 and 1960. Since then, the relations between Brussels and Kinshasa have been tumultuous. They have included such events as the secession of
Katanga
backed by Belgium, the murder of the Prime Minister
Lumumba
by the

Belgian secret services, the expulsion of the Belgian ambassador in the 1960s, the banning of the Sabena company from landing in Kinshasa, and "authentic Zaïrian" policy. The father of
Joseph Kabila
,
Laurent-Désiré Kabila
had very bad relations with Brussels. Many rumours accuse Louis Michel of having used Joseph Kabila as a puppet since his father was murdered in 2001. Therefore, the media has described in a very suspicious way the good relations between Louis Michel and
Joseph Kabila
.
Since 2001, Michel has encouraged the peace process for the Democratic Republic of the Congo that officially put an end to the
Second Congo War
by establishing a
Transitional government
(June 2003 – June 2006). The two main missions of this government were to maintain the peace by integrating all the militias into the unified army and to bring the country to elections on 30 June 2006 having ratified the new constitution by referendum.
In a lecture on 17 January 2008 (entitled Africa-Europe: the indispensable partnership) at the
London School of Economics
, Michel faced Congolese protestors who accused him of being complicit in Kabila's assassination and installing a puppet government in the Congo. The meeting was abandoned shortly before its scheduled end as the chair found it impossible to continue with the interruptions.
In a 2010 magazine interview Michel stated, "Leopold II was a true visionary for his time, a hero." The comment was negatively received in the Congo.
[
13
]
Lebanon
[
edit
]
After the
Israeli-Lebanese conflict
in 2006 the Commissioner visited
Lebanon
and called for €30 million to repair the damage there. The
Parliament's
development committee
was cautious though about the expenditure and he was also criticised for his slow response with one
MEP
comparing him to "a fireman who arrives at the scene after the fire has gone out". In the same debate MEPs attacked the Commissioner for "appearing partial in the Congolese elections" in describing
Joseph Kabila
as "the hope of Congo". Michel responded by saying he would have said the same about any candidate in the democratic elections.
[
14
]
Controversy
[
edit
]
Michel caused some mild controversy in 2007 among MEPs when it became known that he is to take leave from his work to compete in
Belgian elections
. Generally Commissioners are meant to remain above national politics and the
European Parliament's development committee
asked the
Parliament's legal

service
to assess if his participation violates the treaties.
[
15
]
During his absence (12 May 2007 onwards),
Commissioner Rehn
took over his duties.
In 2010, Michel called King
Leopold II of Belgium
, the
Congo Free State
's colonial master
responsible for the deaths
of between 3 million and 10 million
Congolese Africans
, a "visionary hero."
Guy Verhofstadt
, then leader of the Liberals in the European Parliament, refused to comment on Michel's controversial remarks.
[
16
]
[
17
]
In November 2010, Michel led a delegation of 50 MEPs on an eight-day trip to an
ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly
meeting in
Kinshasa
, whose total cost to the Parliament's administrative budget was €1.03 million, an average cost per MEP of €20,511. It was the costliest parliamentary delegation trip outside the EU in 2010.
[
18
]
In 2013, Michel was accused of submitting 229 amendments to an EU data protection bill of which 158 were strongly anti-privacy. First he denied, then he argued his assistant did it. The assistant resigned.
[
19
]
In 2020 Michel's son Mathieu Michel became Belgian State Secretary for Digitization, in charge of Administrative Simplification, Privacy and the Buildings Administration.
