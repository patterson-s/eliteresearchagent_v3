Campaign for UN Secretary General

United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1981
In 1981, Salim Ahmed Salim

ran for
Secretary-General of the United Nations
against the two-term incumbent,
Kurt Waldheim
of Austria. Salim was then serving as
President of the United Nations General Assembly
, and he had the support of the
Organisation of African Unity
and the
Non-Aligned Movement
.
[

]
[
5
]
He could also count on China to veto Waldheim in the Security Council.
[
6
]
However, Salim was opposed by the
Reagan administration
in the United States, which regarded him as an anti-American radical who was hostile to
South Africa
and supported
Palestinian statehood
.
[

]
[
8
]
[
9
]
The Soviet Union also opposed Salim for his activism and his pro-China stance.
[
8
]
Salim won the first round of voting with 11 votes to Waldheim's 10. As expected, Salim was vetoed by the United States, and Waldheim was vetoed by China. Salim's support dropped after the first round, as some countries believed that the United States was implacably opposed to Salim, while China had previously dropped its veto of Waldheim in 1971 and 1976.
[
10
]
However, neither country would relent, as the selection deadlocked for 6 weeks over a total of 16 rounds of voting. The deadlock finally ended when Waldheim and Salim both withdrew from the race, opening up the selection to other candidates.
In 1996, Salim was again mentioned for the office. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali
was running unopposed for a second term and had the support of 14 of the 15 members of the Security Council. The United States was opposed to Boutros-Ghali and offered to support any other African candidate, including Salim Ahmed Salim.
[
11
]
However, France made it clear that it would veto Salim, so he was not nominated.
[
