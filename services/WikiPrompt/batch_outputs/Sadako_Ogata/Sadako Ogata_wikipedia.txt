life

edit

[
1
]
: 219
to a career diplomat father Toyoichi Nakamura (who became in 1943 the Japanese ambassador to
Finland
) and her original name was Sadako Nakamura. Her mother was a daughter of
Foreign Minister
Kenkichi Yoshizawa
and granddaughter of
Prime Minister
Inukai Tsuyoshi
, who was
assassinated
when she was four years old, due to his opposition to Japanese militarism, whose assassination marked the end of civilian control over the Japanese military until after
World War II
.
She was born in Tokyo, Japan and, due to her father's profession, she lived in the U.S. (she attended the
Catlin Gabel School
in Portland) from 4 to 8 years old, also lived in China from 8 to 10 during the Japanese occupation when her father was Japanese consul in Guangzhou and Hong Kong  before the family went back to Japan.
[

]
: 2–8
She stayed in Japan during World War II and after the war, she graduated from the
University of the Sacred Heart
in Tokyo with a
bachelor's degree
in
English Literature
. Though it was not common for a
Japanese woman
to study abroad at that time, she dared to study at
Georgetown University
and its
Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service
, earning a
master's degree
in
International Relations
. She wanted to study the reason why Japan entered a reckless aggression war, which was not put a brake on after the assassination of her great-grandfather,
Prime Minister
Inukai Tsuyoshi
.
[

]
: 34
She was awarded a
PhD
in
Political Science
from the
University of California, Berkeley
in 1963, after she completed a dissertation on the politics behind the foundation of
Manchukuo
. The study analyzed the causes of the
Japanese invasion of China
. As for her personal life, in 1960 she married
Shijuro Ogata
and her name changed from Sadako Nakamura to Sadako Ogata. In 1965, she became Lecturer at
International Christian University
in Tokyo. After 1980, she taught international politics at
Sophia University
in Tokyo
[

: 221
as a professor and later became Dean of the Faculty of Foreign Studies until her departure to join the UNHCR in 1991.
Career
[
edit
]
Ogata at the World Economic Forum on Africa,
Cape Town
,
South Africa
, on 4 June 2008
United

Nations / United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
[
edit
]
Ogata was appointed to Japan's UN mission in 1968, on the recommendation of
Fusae Ichikawa
, a female member of the
House of Councillors
of Japan, who was an activist of the women's suffrage in Japan since the 1920s and had a high opinion of Ogata's character & ability. Ogata represented Japan at several sessions of the
UN General Assembly
in 1970. In addition, she served from 1978 to 1979 as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary for the permanent mission of Japan to the UN, and as Chair of the UNICEF Executive Board.
[
2
]
[
3
]
In 1990, she was appointed as head of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). She was the first woman to be appointed as a head of the UNHCR.
[
6
]
She left
Sophia University
to start her new position at UNHCR. Her presumed term at UNHCR was only three years, which was the remaining term of her predecessor who had left after only one year, but she continued to be assigned. She was re-elected twice (in November 1993 and in September 1998),
[
7
]
and served, over a decade, until 2001.
[
8
]
As head of the UNHCR, she implemented effective strategies and helped countless refugees escape from despair, including Kurdish refugees after
the Gulf War
, refugees in the
Yugoslav Wars
, refugees in the
Rwandan genocide
, and Afghan refugees including victims of
Cold War
.
[
8
]
In the face of Kurdish refugees at the border between Turkey and Iraq, Ogata expanded the mandate of UNHCR to include the protection of internally displaced persons (
IDPs
).
[
8
]
She was a practical leader who deployed military forces in the humanitarian operations, for example at the siege of
Sarajevo
, the Airlift Operations in cooperation with some European air forces during the
Bosnian War
.
[
8
]
During the period, the budget and the staff in UNHCR more than doubled.
[
9
]
Her formidable negotiating skills and petite stature earned her the nickname of "diminutive giant."
After UNHCR leader, in 2001, she became co-chairperson of UN Human Security Commission.
RET International
[
edit
]
In December 2000, and coinciding with the end of her second term at the High Commission at UNHCR, as well as the 50th anniversary

of the agency, Ogata announced the launch of
RET International
in Geneva, Switzerland. Ogata’s vision for RET was to bridge a massive gap she had witnessed during her tenure as the head of the UN Refugee Agency, specifically in education for youth.
The organization, whose initials stood for
Refugee Education Trust
, would be devoted to secondary education for refugees as Ogata saw this as a critical gap in need of a solution. She believed that if adolescents and youth are not given any opportunities, they will become extremely vulnerable to illegal activities, gangs, underage labor, drug trafficking, sexual abuse, sex trafficking, and violence. RET, therefore, would aim to provide them with the skills to confront these threats, develop their resilience to become self-reliant.
At inception, RET worked exclusively in refugee camps using education as a tool. However, as refugee migration patterns changed and new crises emerged, the paradigm shifted in different parts of the world and the organization developed methods specifically for refugee camps, proved to be adaptable to young people in fragile environments in general.
As of 2025, the organization remains headquartered in Geneva operates in 15 countries around the world. It has worked directly with a number of UN agencies over the years, including UNHCR, as well as governments, and private foundations to provide opportunities to vulnerable communities.
Japanese government / JICA President
[
edit
]
In 2001, after the
September 11 attacks
, she was appointed as Special Representative of Prime Minister of Japan on Reconstruction Assistance to
Afghanistan
.
Ogata in 2012
The
Koizumi government
approached Ogata as a candidate to replace
Makiko Tanaka
as Japanese foreign minister in early 2002, but Ogata refused to accept the position. Although Ogata did not publicly explain her refusal,
Kuniko Inoguchi
told
The New York Times
that Ogata "would hate to be used as a token or a figurehead because she has fought all her life for the condition of women, and she wouldn't help someone who would try to use her for their political purposes."
[
10
]
Next year, going back to Tokyo, the
Japanese government
appointed her as President of the
Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) on 1 October 2003. It was reported that young JICA officials expressed their strong desire for her leadership, even before the formal appointment.
[
5
]
: 262–264
She led JICA with her emphasis on ideas from fields and

Human Security.
[
5
]

She built up peace-building projects on Afghanistan and Mindanao.
[
5
]
: 272–281

[
5
]
: 281–287
She continued to work as president of JICA for more than two terms (over eight years), retiring in April 2012 to be succeeded by
Akihiko Tanaka
.
She was a member of The Advisory Council on the Imperial House Law on 27 November 2014. The council was
Junichiro Koizumi
then-
Prime Minister
's private advisory organ which belonged to the
Cabinet Office
.
[
11
]
[
12
]
The council met 17 times from 25 January 2005 to discuss the
Japanese succession controversy
and the
Imperial Household Act

Both Ogata and
Empress Michiko

Tokyo
.
[

Prime Minister
Yoshihiko Noda
gave a speech. He said "Because of the
