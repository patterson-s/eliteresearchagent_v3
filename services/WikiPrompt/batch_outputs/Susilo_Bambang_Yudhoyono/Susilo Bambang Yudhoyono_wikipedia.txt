Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
(
Indonesian:
[suˌsilo
ˌbambaŋ
judhoˈjono]
; born 9 September 1949), commonly referred to as
SBY
(
Indonesian:
[ɛsˈbeje]
), is an Indonesian politician and retired
army
general who served as the sixth
President of Indonesia
from 2004 to 2014 and the second President of Indonesia from the military after
Suharto
. He founded the
Democratic Party of Indonesia
and served as its 4th chairman from 2014 until 2020. He also served as the 8th and 10th
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs
from 2000 until 2001 and again from 2001 until 2004. He also served as the president of the Assembly and chair of the Council of the
Global Green Growth Institute
.
Yudhoyono won the
2004 presidential election
—the first
direct
presidential election in Indonesia, defeating incumbent President
Megawati Sukarnoputri
. He was sworn into office on 20 October 2004, together with
Jusuf Kalla
as
Vice President
. He ran for
re-election in 2009
with
Boediono
as his running mate, and won with an outright majority of the votes in the first round of balloting; he was sworn in for a second term on 20 October

2009.
During his tenure as president, Indonesia participated in many world peace missions, both at the national and international levels. Yudhoyono successfully negotiated a
deal
that ended the
Aceh insurgency
, an insurgency which lasted from 1976 to 2005. As a result, he was given the title "Father of Peace."
[

Yudhoyono also chaired the 18th and 19th
ASEAN Summits
in 2011 and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award (
Champions of the Earth
) in 2014.

Name
[
edit
]
The name
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
is of
Javanese
origins, with
Sanskrit
roots.
Susilo
comes from the words
su-
, meaning "good" and
-sila
, meaning "behaviour, conduct, or moral."
Bambang
is a traditional male name in Javanese, meaning "knight," while
Yudhoyono
comes from the words
yuddha
, meaning "battle, fight"; and
yana
, meaning "journey." Thus his full name roughly translates to "well behaved knight on a war mission."
[
5
]
The name "Yudhoyono" is not an inherited surname;
most Javanese do not have surnames
. Rather, he chose it for his military name-tag, and it is how he is referred to abroad.
[
6
]
[
7
]
[
8
]
His children and grandchildren go by the name "Yudhoyono," and in formal meetings and functions he is addressed as Dr. Yudhoyono. In Indonesia, he is usually referred to and widely known as "SBY."

Early life and education
[

Early life and family
[
edit
]
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was born on 9 September 1949, in Tremas, a village in Arjosari,
Pacitan Regency
,
East Java
, to a lower-middle-class family. His father was a Javanese man named Raden Soekotjo (1925 – 4 August 2001), whose lineage can be traced to
Hamengkubuwono II
,
[
10
]
while his mother was a Javanese woman named Siti Habibah (30 June 1932 – 30 August 2019).
[
11
]
Education
[
edit
]
Yudhoyono had wanted to join the army since he was a child.
[
12
]
In school, he developed a reputation as an academic achiever, excelling in writing poems, short stories, and play-acting.
[
citation needed
]
Yudhoyono was also talented in music and sport, reflected when he and his friends established a volleyball club called
Klub Rajawali
and a band called
Gaya Teruna
.
[
13
]
When he was in fifth grade, Yudhoyono visited

the Indonesian Armed Forces Academy (AKABRI). After seeing the soldiers training there and perhaps inspired by his own father's career, Yudhoyono became determined to join the
Indonesian Armed Forces
and become a soldier. Yudhoyono planned to enlist after graduating from high school in 1968; however, he missed the registration period.
[
12
]
Young Yudhoyono then became a student under the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the
Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology
(ITS) in Surabaya before entering the Vocational Education Development Center in
Malang
, East Java. There, he was able to prepare everything for the next phase of his education at the military academy
AKABRI
. Yudhoyono officially entered AKABRI in 1970 after passing the test in
Bandung
.
[
12
]
Yudhoyono also studied in the
United States
, where he received his master's degree in Business Management from
Webster University
in 1991. He subsequently earned
PhD
in
agricultural economics
from the
Bogor Agricultural University
on 3 October 2004, two days before his presidential victory was announced.
[
14
]
He was also awarded two honorary doctorates in 2005 in the fields, respectively, of law from his alma mater, Webster University, and in political science from
Thammasat University
in Thailand. On 12 June 2014, he earned
professor
degree from Defense University of Indonesia in National Defense Science.

Cadet First Sergeant Major (

) Yudhoyono, 1973
Yudhoyono spent three years at
AKABRI
and became the commander of the Cadet Corps Division there. He graduated from AKABRI as second lieutenant in 1973, and as the best graduate of the year, received the prestigious Adhi Makayasa medal from President
Suharto
.
[

Kostrad
[
edit
]
After graduating, Yudhoyono joined the Army Strategic Reserve (
Kostrad
) and became a
platoon
commander in the 330th Airborne Battalion. Aside from leading his troops, Yudhoyono was also tasked with giving the battalion soldiers lessons on general knowledge and English. Yudhoyono's proficiency in English was one of the reasons why he was sent to the United States to undertake the
Airborne
and
Ranger
Courses at
Fort Benning
in 1975.
[
16
]
Yudhoyono returned to Indonesia in 1976, where he became a platoon commander in the 305th Battalion and was assigned to
Indonesian-occupied
East Timor
. Yudhoyono had several tours of duty and, like many

other Indonesian officers involved in the occupation of East Timor, was accused of committing
war crimes
.
[
17
]
However, Yudhoyono has never been charged with any specific act. From East Timor, Yudhoyono became a
mortar
platoon commander in 1977, an operations officer for an airborne brigade from 1977 to 1978, and a company commander at
Kostrad
from 1979 to 1981. Yudhoyono then spent 1981 and 1982 working at the Army headquarters.
[
18
]
While working at the Army headquarters, Yudhoyono was sent to the United States again, this time to participate in the
Infantry Officer Advanced Course
at Fort Benning and in training with the
82nd Airborne Division
. Yudhoyono also spent time in
Panama
and went through the jungle warfare school. When Yudhoyono returned in 1983, he was made commander of the Infantry Trainers' School. It was not long before he was abroad again, this time to
Belgium
and
West Germany
, to undertake the
Antitank weapons
Course. In 1985, Yudhoyono also took a Battalion Commando Course in
Malaysia
.
[

]
From 1986 to 1988, Yudhoyono served with
Kodam IX/Udayana
, which covers
Bali
and the
Lesser Sunda Islands
. Yudhoyono was a battalion commander from 1986 to 1988 and was part of the operational staff in 1988. In 1989, Yudhoyono became a lecturer at the Army Staff College (Seskoad) and delivered a presentation entitled "ABRI's Professionalism at the Present and in the Future". Together with
Agus Wirahadikusumah
, Yudhoyono published a book entitled "The Challenges of Development".
[
16
]
Whilst at Seskoad, Yudhoyono also took the opportunity to further his own military education. He went to the
US Army Command and General Staff College
at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas
. While in the United States, he took the opportunity to obtain an MA degree in business management from
Webster University
in 1991.
[
19
]
In 1992, Yudhoyono was transferred to the Army Information Department and worked as a speechwriter for General Edi Sudrajat, the Army chief of staff. In 1993, when Edi became commander of the
Military of Indonesia
(ABRI), Yudhoyono joined Edi's personal staff. Edi did not last long as ABRI commander and Yudhoyono was then transferred back to Kostrad where he became a brigade commander. A year later, Yudhoyono was the operations assistant at Jaya (Jakarta) Military Area Command before taking command IV/Diponegoro Military Area Command in
Central Java

. Yudhoyono had one more stint overseas when he became Indonesia's chief military observer of the
United Nation Peacekeeping Force
in
Bosnia
in 1995–96.
[
20
]
When Yudhoyono returned to Indonesia, he was made KODAM Jaya chief of staff before being appointed as KODAM II/Sriwijaya commander. In this position, Yudhoyono was responsible for military operations in southern
Sumatra
.
[
21
]
He served in this position until 1997, when he was appointed chief of staff for social-political affairs. At the same time, he was also appointed chairman of the
ABRI
Faction in the
People's Consultative Assembly
General Session and participated in
Suharto
's election to a seventh term as president.

Suharto's resignation

Main article:
Fall of Suharto
General Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in official military portrait, 2000
During the days which would lead to
Suharto's resignation
in May 1998, Yudhoyono and pro-reform ABRI officers conducted meetings and discussions with
Nurcholish Madjid
, a secular pro-reform Muslim leader. From his discussions, Yudhoyono accepted the fact that Suharto should resign but like the ABRI officers who went to the meeting with him, was reluctant to withdraw their support of Suharto publicly, much less ask for Suharto's resignation.
[
23
]
Nevertheless, the pressure eventually become too much for Suharto, who resigned on 21 May 1998.
As Indonesia entered the
reform era
, ABRI's popularity, because of its association with Suharto, was at an all-time low. To de-emphasise ABRI's political role, Yudhoyono's chief of staff for social-political affairs was renamed chief of staff for territorial affairs and in 1999,
ABRI
was renamed TNI and the
Indonesian National Police
(Polri) was split off. At this time, Yudhoyono's popularity began to increase
[
citation needed
]
as he offered ideas and concepts to reform the military and nation. He did this by combining the strong reformist sentiment of the time with TNI's concern for security and stability.
[
23
]
Because of his high education (finishing his doctorate during the course of the presidential elections) and his well-planned manoeuvres, Yudhoyono came to be known as "the thinking general."

Political career

Wahid presidency
[

Yudhoyono's official portrait as minister of mining and energy, 1999
Yudhoyono was appointed mining and energy minister in the
cabinet
of President
Abdurrahman Wahid
in 1999. According to General
Wiranto
, who assisted Wahid in the formation

of the Cabinet, he had recommended to the president that Yudhoyono would do better as Army chief of staff.
[
24
]
However, Wahid rejected the idea and Yudhoyono became the minister of mining and energy instead. At the same time, Yudhoyono ended his military career with the rank of
lieutenant general
, although he would be made honorary general in 2000.
[
25
]
Yudhoyono's popularity grew,
[
citation needed
]
even as minister of mining and energy. In June 2000, there were rumours that Wahid, because of his lack of skill as an administrator was going to appoint a first minister to look after the day-to-day running of the government.
[
26
]
Yudhoyono's name appeared as a potential candidate for the position, although eventually Wahid appointed Vice President
Megawati Sukarnoputri
as the day to day administrator.
In August 2000, after a cabinet reshuffle, Yudhoyono became the coordinating minister for politic and security affairs. One of his tasks was to separate the army from politics. This was in line with his reformist ideas on the future of Indonesian military, and is a view he has held since his days in an army policy center. He said at that time:
Since 1998, the military has decided to stay out of day-to-day politics. The basic idea of military reform is to go back to the role and function of the military as a defense force and move them away from politics systematically. The trend is moving in such a way that there is no so-called 'dual function' of the military, there is no so-called social political mission in the military.
Another task that Yudhoyono was given was as an intermediary between Wahid and the Suharto family. At the time, Wahid was trying to make Suharto hand back all the money which he had allegedly obtained through corruption when he was president.
[
citation needed
]
Yudhoyono was sent by Wahid to convey this wish and to negotiate with the former first family. However, Yudhoyono was not successful in this venture.
At the beginning of 2001, with political pressure increasing on him, Wahid ordered Yudhoyono to form a crisis centre with Yudhoyono as chairman
[
27
]
The purpose of this crisis centre was to assist the president in giving policy advice and was headquartered at Yudhoyono's office. It seemed as if because of this appointment, Yudhoyono could be considered one

of Wahid's men, however Yudhoyono would break ranks from Wahid in July 2001 when the latter was facing impeachment. In desperation, Wahid issued a decree freezing the
People's Representative Council
(DPR) and then asked Yudhoyono to declare a
state of emergency
to further strengthen his position. Yudhoyono refused to accept this, and Wahid dismissed him.

On 23 July 2001, in a special session, the MPR impeached Wahid and replaced him with Megawati as president. A few days later when the MPR assembled to
elect a new vice president
[

]
, Yudhoyono threw his name in the hat and competed against
Golkar
's
Akbar Tanjung
and
United Development Party
's (PPP)
Hamzah Haz
.
[
27
]
Yudhoyono and Akbar lost out to Hamzah Haz who became the new vice president.
Yudhoyono was appointed to his old position of coordinating minister of political and security affairs in Megawati's
new cabinet
. After the
Bali bombings
in October 2002, he oversaw the hunt for and arrest of those responsible, and gained a reputation both in Indonesia and abroad as one of the few Indonesian politicians who was serious about the
war on terrorism
. His speech during the first anniversary of the Bali bombings (in which many Australians were killed) was praised by the Australian media and public.
[
28
]
Yudhoyono also dealt with the
Free Aceh Movement
(GAM), a separatist movement wanting to separate the Province of
Aceh
from Indonesia. On his advice, Megawati declared
martial law
in Aceh on 19 May 2003, which was then extended in November.
[
29
]
Democratic Party
[
edit
]
Democratic Party
Yudhoyono's supporters saw Yudhoyono's participation in the vice-presidential election as a sign of his popularity and recognised Yudhoyono's potential as a possible leader for Indonesia. One of these supporters, Vence Rumangkang approached Yudhoyono with the idea of forming a political party to help shore up support for the
2004 presidential elections
. Yudhoyono approved of the idea and after going through the basic concepts, left Rumangkang in charge of forming the Party.
[
30
]
From 12 to 19 August 2001, Rumangkang began holding a series of meetings to discuss the formation of the party while holding consultations with Yudhoyono. Yudhoyono personally led the meetings on 19 and

20 August 2001, and the basic outline of the Democratic Party was finalised.
On 9 September 2001, the formation of the party was officially declared, and it was registered at the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights on 10 September.
The organizers behind Democratic Party's formation went to extreme lengths to make sure that PD was Yudhoyono's personal political party. The declaration of its formation was 9 September 2001, which was Yudhoyono's birthday, and the Party originally had 99 members.
Road to presidency
[
edit
]
Main article:
2004 Indonesian presidential election
Yudhoyono in the United Nations
The
United Democratic Nationhood Party
(PPDK) was the first to bring up the subject of nomination. In September 2003, Yudhoyono's own party began to make preparations in case Yudhoyono was willing to accept a presidential nomination. The Democratic Party then initiated a publicity campaign to promote Yudhoyono as a candidate. For his part, Yudhoyono was not responsive to both PPDK and the Democratic Party's manoeuvrings to nominate him and continued his duties as minister. PPDK was disappointed in Yudhoyono's reaction, and the Democratic Party continued to wait for Yudhoyono to resign his position, as was expected of all presidential candidates apart from the incumbent president and vice president.
[
31
]
The turning point came on 1 March 2004, when Yudhoyono's secretary, Sudi Silalahi announced to the media that for the last six months, Yudhoyono had been excluded from policy decision-making in the field of politics and security.
[
32
]
On 2 March 2004, Megawati responded that she had never excluded Yudhoyono, while her husband,
Taufiq Kiemas
called Yudhoyono childish for complaining to the media instead of the president herself. On 8 March 2004, Yudhoyono sent a letter asking for permission to meet the president about his ministerial authority. Megawati did not respond when she received the letter, although she invited Yudhoyono along to a cabinet meeting on 11 March 2004. Yudhoyono did not attend the cabinet meeting and instead held a press conference at his office and announced his resignation from the position of coordinating minister of political and security affairs. He also announced that he was ready to be nominated as a presidential candidate.
Yudhoyono's popularity skyrocketed after his falling out with Megawati as he was seen by the people as the
underdog
. However this popularity did not translate to a victory for the Democratic Party at the
2004

legislative elections
. The party won 7.5% of the votes, which was still enough to nominate Yudhoyono as a presidential candidate. Yudhoyono accepted the nomination and picked
Golkar
's
Jusuf Kalla
as his running mate. Aside from the Democratic Party, their presidential and vice-presidential candidacy was supported by the
Crescent Star Party
(PBB), the
Reform Star Party
(PBR) and the
Indonesian Justice and Unity Party
(PKPI).
[
33
]
The rapid rise of Yudhoyono's (center) popularity helped the Democratic Party garner 7.45% of votes during the April 2004 legislative election.
[
34
]
Yudhoyono's
manifesto
for the future of Indonesia, summarised in a book titled
Vision For Change
written by him and distributed for free during the campaign, was built on four pillars: prosperity, peace, justice and democracy. At the top of his agenda was a plan for increasing economic prosperity, aiming for economic growth of at least 7% and a revival of small and medium-sized enterprises. He also put forward policies to offer better credit lines, to cut red tape, improve labour laws and to root out corruption from the top down. He told an interviewer:
If we are to reduce poverty, create jobs, increase purchasing power and rebuild infrastructure, then we will need new capital. Of course, to be able to invite investment, I have to improve the climate – legal certainties, political stability, law and order, sound tax policies, customs policies, good labor management. I will improve the guarantees to encourage investors to come to Indonesia.
Yudhoyono's perceived communication skills made him the front-runner throughout the election campaign, according to many opinion polls and the opinions of election commentators,
[
35
]
ahead of the other candidates (Megawati, Wiranto,
Amien Rais
, and Hamzah). On 5 July 2004, Yudhoyono participated in the first round of the
presidential election
, coming first with 33% of the votes. However, 50% of votes were required for a new president and vice president to be elected, and this meant Yudhoyono going into a run-off against Megawati.
In the run-off, Yudhoyono faced a challenge from Megawati's
Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle
(PDI-P), forming a national coalition with Golkar, the PPP,
Prosperous Peace Party
(PDS) and the
Indonesian National Party
(PNI). Yudhoyono then declared that his coalition, which now received political support from the
National Awakening Party
(PKB), the
Prosperous Justice Party
(PKS) and the
National Mandate Party
(PAN), would be the people's coalition. On

20 September 2004, Yudhoyono participated in the run-off election, winning it with 60.87% of the vote. Yudhoyono was inaugurated as president on 20 October 2004.

On the day of his inauguration in 2004, Yudhoyono announced his new cabinet, which would be known as the
United Indonesia Cabinet
(
Kabinet Indonesia Bersatu
). Consisting of 36 ministers, it included members of the Democratic Party, Golkar and the PPP, PBB, PKB, PAN, PKP, and PKS. Professionals were also named in the cabinet, most of them taking on ministries in the economic field. The
military
were also included, with five former members appointed to the cabinet. As Yudhoyono's promised during the election, four of the cabinet appointees were female.
[

Yudhoyono's
Second United Indonesia Cabinet
was announced in October 2009 after he was
re-elected
as president earlier in the year. The vice president in Yudhoyono's second cabinet was
Boediono
, who replaced
Jusuf Kalla
, Yudhoyono's vice president in his first cabinet.
Balance of political power with Kalla
[

Although he had won the presidency, Yudhoyono was still weak in the Indonesian parliament, the
House of Representatives
(DPR). The Democratic Party, even combined with all of its coalition partners, had far fewer representatives than Golkar and the PDI-P, which played the role of opposition. With a national congress to be held in December 2004, Yudhoyono and Kalla had originally backed
Agung Laksono
speaker to become Golkar chairman. When Agung was perceived to be too weak to run against
Akbar Tandjung
, Yudhoyono and Kalla threw their weight behind
Surya Paloh
. Finally, when Paloh was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono gave the green light for Kalla to run for the
Golkar
Chairmanship.
[
38
]
On 19 December 2004, Kalla was elected as the new chairman of Golkar. Kalla's victory posed a dilemma for Yudhoyono. Although it now enabled Yudhoyono to pass legislation, Kalla's new position

meant that he was now more powerful than Yudhoyono in terms of influence in parliament.
After the
2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
Kalla, apparently on his own initiative, assembled Ministers and signed a vice-presidential decree ordering work to begin on rehabilitating Aceh. The legality of his vice-presidential decree was questioned
[
39
]
although Yudhoyono maintained that it was he who gave the orders for Kalla to proceed.
In September 2005, when Yudhoyono went to
New York City
to attend the annual United Nations Summit, he left Vice President Kalla in charge. Yudhoyono held a
video conference
from New York to receive reports from ministers. Critics suggest that this was an expression of distrust by Yudhoyono.
[
40
]
The suggestion seemed to gain momentum when Kalla only showed up for one video conference and then spent the rest of the time taking care of Golkar matters.
To defuse political tensions stemming from protests over rising fuel prices, President Yudhoyono dispatched Vice President
Jusuf Kalla
to meet with several national figures, including former President
Abdurrahman Wahid
and
Megawati Sukarnoputri
.
Vice President Kalla's arrival at the residence of former President
Abdurrahman Wahid
in Ciganjur, Jakarta, was greeted by
Yenny Wahid
, Gus Dur's eldest daughter, on the porch. Kalla, wearing a long-sleeved batik shirt, immediately entered the living room where Gus Dur was waiting. After shaking hands and hugging, Kalla sat on a long chair to Gus Dur's left with Ibu Mufidah. Meanwhile, Ibu
Sinta Nuriyah
sat beside Yenny Wahid. The conversation immediately became warm, interspersed with Gus Dur's characteristic jokes.
[
41
]
Vice President Kalla was greeted by former President
Megawati Sukarnoputri
,
Taufiq Kiemas
, and her eldest daughter,
Puan Maharani
. The two leaders engaged in a relaxed conversation, with Megawati briefly discussing food. Meanwhile, the Vice President responded in a friendly manner, resulting in very warm communication. The meeting, which lasted approximately 15 minutes, gave the impression that there had never been any differences between the two leaders
[
41
]
President Yudhoyono's first term was relatively stable due to his strategy of maintaining balance, but in his second term, when he chose a civil bureaucrat as his vice president, political attacks began to emerge that shook his government.
Dealings with Suharto
[
edit
]
On 6 May 2005, Yudhoyono visited Suharto at hospital when the latter suffered from intestinal bleeding. On 5 January 2007, Yudhoyono

and his wife visited Suharto, who was again hospitalised due to anaemia as well as heart and kidney problems.
[
42
]
[
43
]
After the visit, Yudhoyono made an appeal to all Indonesians to pray for Suharto's recovery.
[
44
]
Responding to some public requests for Suharto to be granted a pardon for possible past mistakes in governing Indonesia, presidential spokesperson Andi Mallarangeng said, "A visit from an incumbent president to a hospitalized former president is something normal. However, this show of humanity and legal steps are two different things."

Vladimir Putin
to sign a defense deal in Jakarta, September 2007
President Yudhoyono's foreign policy sought to create new breakthroughs for the strategic development of Indonesia's defense, namely ending the US military embargo, which was aided by support from Washington. The Bush administration claimed that ending the arms embargo and modernizing the
Indonesian Defence Force
will help
Jakarta
address mutual security concerns such as terrorism, maritime piracy, narcotics trafficking, pandemic disease, and disaster relief. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that Indonesia, as "the world's largest Muslim state and its third-largest democracy, is a voice of moderation in the Islamic world and plays a unique strategic role in Southeast Asia".
[
46
]
In February 2005, the US government reinstated Indonesia's eligibility for the International Military Education and Training program in order to upgrade the quality of its officer corps. In May 2005, it removed restrictions on nonlethal defense equipment such as communications and transport systems. This lifted the last remaining barrier, a ban on sale of lethal weaponry and related equipment. Still recovering from the
Asian financial crisis
, the Indonesian government lacked the funds to purchase new armaments but took advantage of the new rules to purchase spare parts for its aging fleet of 10 U.S.-supplied F-16 fighters. Invoking these accomplishments at the
APEC
conference, Yudhoyono argued that Indonesia had proven itself worthy of resumed military engagement with the United States.
[
47
]
While there, he also spoke with Russian President
Vladimir Putin
about further defense cooperation with Moscow following the 2003 purchase

of four Sukhoi warplanes and two MI-35 assault helicopters. In addition to its dealings with the
United States
and
Russia
, Yudhoyono considered purchasing weapons from other potential suppliers, which included several
European Union
countries,
South Korea
,
India
, and
China
.

Aceh Peace Agreement
[
edit
]
During his leadership, President Yudhoyono achieved many important achievements, especially related to domestic stability. The Indonesian government succeeded in reaching a peace agreement with the
Free Aceh Movement
(GAM). The memorandum of understanding was signed in
Helsinki
,
Finland
, on August 15, 2005.
[
48
]
The conflict that has been going on for almost thirty years was initially a form of dissatisfaction with the socio-economic inequality that occurred in Aceh, especially during the
New Order era
. Resistance to the New Order government has turned into an armed conflict that has claimed thousands of lives. GAM has an army that conducts guerrilla warfare that disrupts national stability. Various efforts have been made by the government from time to time, but GAM continues to exist.
Peace negotiations between GAM and the Indonesian government initially began at the beginning of the reform era but stalled due to misunderstandings between the two parties. Then the negotiations were restarted during the Yudhoyono administration, the Indonesian government's chief negotiator, Mr.
Awaludin
, explained why the peace process in Aceh was successful from his perspective as the Indonesian government's chief negotiator during the
Helsinki Agreement
. The government began the peace negotiations with a clear action plan and reasonable offers, including an amnesty for the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and a clear and concrete social, political and economic justice program.
[
49
]
President Yudhoyono succeeded in convincing the military, parliament and the international community to actively participate in monitoring and safeguarding the
Aceh
peace process, as he had already been actively involved in negotiations since 2000 when he served as
Minister of Politics and Security
[
50
]
and also important factors, especially the
2004 tsunami disaster
, which encouraged both sides to focus more on helping victims than fighting, and international pressure on GAM to enter the negotiations. Ultimately, the sincerity of both sides commitment to dialogue proved decisive.
Law enforcement and political role model
[
edit
]
In the field of law enforcement, President Yudhoyono's government has succeeded in making a number of breakthroughs in the culture of law

enforcement in Indonesia. The President strives to make law enforcement in Indonesia, especially during his administration, more authoritative. In 2005, former Bank Indonesia deputy Aulia Pohan, who is also the in-law of his son Agus Harimurti, was arrested by the
Corruption Eradication Commission
(KPK),
[
51
]
this was the first case involving a relative of a leader in this country. He also tried to prioritize a culture of legal order, for example, the Corruption Court Law
[
52
]
and the Juvenile Court Law.
[
53
]
He also did not hesitate to dismiss ministers suspected of corruption, even though the minister was his former spokesman and came from the same party as him.
[
54
]
The dismissal of an active minister suspected of corruption and already a corruption suspect was the first case in Indonesia of an active minister being a corruption suspect.
[
55
]
In 2008, the
global financial crisis
occurred. The Indonesian government, which had already had bitter experience during the
Asian financial crisis
, tried to be more responsive in handling the crisis, especially during the Yudhoyono presidency. He tried to build togetherness in handling the global financial crisis, with Indonesia actively participating in the
G20
. Also at that time, he succeeded in maintaining a calm and stable domestic economic condition in handling the crisis with the policy of closing the
Indonesian Stock Exchange
[
56
]
and providing bailout funds for Bank Century to prevent panic in the financial industry. At last, Indonesia managed to survive the crisis unlike ten years ago,
[
57
]
the steps he took were quick and tactical. He also did not forget about law enforcement by supporting the arrest of several people who took personal advantage of the policy, such as the arrest of the President Director of Bank Century and the Deputy Governor of
Bank Indonesia
.
[
58
]
President Yudhoyono's administration is striving to create a new tradition that the democratic political system is not solely for personal and group gain, but rather for serving the people. At an event organized by the Indonesian Student Association (HIPMI), the President stated,
[
59
]
"I am not a presidential candidate in 2014. My wife and children will not run for president either, and I have never prepared anyone to run for president. Let the people and democracy speak for themselves in this election,"

Yudhoyono said.
Previously, rumors circulated about amendments to the 1945 Constitution regarding presidential terms and the possibility of presidential family members running for re-election. The President sought to clear the political air at the time. He also strengthened Indonesia's democratic system by ensuring a smooth and orderly leadership transition.
[
60
]
Economic policy
[
edit
]
In a meeting with regional heads, President Yudhoyono outlined some of the government's achievements in the economic field
"We should be grateful for the economic achievements that have been made, although there are still some that have not been achieved," he explained. He added that the economic conditions at the beginning of his first term in 2004 were still characterized by low GDP and significant economic growth, as well as minimal infrastructure. He said the process of economic consolidation then began, and social and security conditions became more stable after peaceful and democratic elections. Civil servant salaries remain low, while the health budget remains limited, he added.
He indicated that GDP and foreign exchange reserves had increased significantly and the ratio of debt to
gross domestic product
could be reduced from 56 percent to 23 percent. President Yudhoyono added that the debt ratio of 23 percent to GDP was far below developed countries such as
Germany
(86.1 percent),
United States
(104.1 percent), and
United Kingdom
( 107 percent). He said, during the 2004–2014 period, domestic and foreign debt could also be reduced while the state budget was increased fourfold. In 2004, the country's per capita income was recorded at US$1188 but ten years later it rose to US$3490. Indonesia is also recorded as a country with the second highest economic growth rate since 2009 after
China
with the country's exports increasing threefold. In the energy sector, Yudhoyono acknowledged, although electricity capacity increased twice during his administration, it remained small. Yudhoyono gave the example of the Master Plan for the Acceleration of Indonesian Economic Development (MP3EI), which from 2011 to 2013, reached a value of IDR 828.7 trillion.
[
61
]
Yudhoyono was also able to initiate the disbanding of the
Consultative Group on Indonesia
(CGI) because he wanted Indonesia to be more independent and less dependent on many parties. President Yudhoyono said
Indonesia no longer needs to discuss development program plans with creditor forums. "Indonesia will do everything by itself without the help of CGI. Because of that, we see that there is

no need for a CGI forum anymore," he explained, the CGI dissolution policy had been started since last year. He also emphasized the importance of the Indonesian people to be more independent in planning and implementing development. The dissolution of CGI, he said, demanded Indonesia's full responsibility to determine the budget and meet financial needs.
Established in 1992, the CGI was a consortium of countries and institutions providing loans to Indonesia, set up by the Indonesian government and the World Bank. Its membership was made up of 30 bilateral and multilateral creditors, including the
World Bank
, the
Asian Development Bank
, the
International Monetary Fund
and industrialized countries such as
Japan
and the
United States
, as well as many other smaller countries and many other world financial and aid institutions. In 2006 the Consultative Group on Indonesia pledged $5.4 billion in fresh loans and grants for Indonesia. Finance Minister
Sri Mulyani
said the
Consultative Group on Indonesia
(CGI) was no longer needed as the country's primary creditors were only the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan, and that Indonesia now preferred one-on-one negotiations rather than round table, multilateral ones. She said the dissolution of the CGI was also of benefit to Indonesia as it freed the government of the need to explain its intentions and plans to many different parties. Iman Sugema, director of the International Center for Applied Finance and Economics (Inter-CAFE) at the
Bogor Institute of Agriculture
(IPB), applauded the president's plan to dissolve the CGI and said the CGI had not benefited
Indonesia
because the donor countries often put too many demands on the nation.

Education and social protection
[
edit
]
BPJS Kesehatan
The Yudhoyono administration also strives to ensure that all Indonesians are protected through national social security, which can improve the welfare and protection of Indonesians in the areas of health and old-age security. This is achieved through Law No. 24 of 2011 concerning the Social Security Administering Body (BPJS). This law is a government initiative to improve public welfare through a health and employment insurance system. According to the
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare
,
Agung Laksono
"Private insurance companies need not worry about the implementation of Law concerning the Social Security Administering Body (BPJS), there will still be middle to upper income groups who need their services"
The law calls for the establishment of

a Social Security System which will be operated by an institution that will be formed by combining two state-owned companies, namely PT Jamsostek which provides workers' social security BPJS Ketenagakerjaan and PT Askes which is engaged in health insurance
BPJS Kesehatan
. The merger of the two companies was expected to occur before 1 January 2014. Meanwhile, according to Suryo Bambang Sulisto, Chairman of the
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(Kadin)
[
63
]
"Indonesian entrepreneurs accepted the law as something positive and Kadin members were ready to apply it in their companies"
In the field of education, Yudhoyono has implemented a number of programs to improve the development of Indonesian human resources, including the
Schools Operational Assistance
[
id
]
(BOS) program which was established in July 2005.
[
64
]
Under this arrangement, the government provides money to school principals to help finance the running of schools. BOS is expected to provide significant financial assistance to schools, schools are expected to reduce fees or if they are able, eliminate fees altogether, in addition in June 2006, Yudhoyono launched "BOS Buku" which provides funds for the purchase of textbooks.
[
65
]
In 2011, he founded
LPDP
, a social institution that provides scholarships for Indonesian children who want to continue their higher education at home and abroad.
[
66
]
He also founded the Indonesian Defense University, a higher education institution that specifically studies military and defense strategy studies
[
67
]
and near the institution was founded the
Indonesia Peace and Security Center

(IPSC) an institution that specifically educates Indonesian peacekeeping troops for the UN, which he initiated because of his time as part of the
