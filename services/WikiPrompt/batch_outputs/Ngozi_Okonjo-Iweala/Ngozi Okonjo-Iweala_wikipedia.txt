Career
[
edit

World Bank
[
edit
]
Okonjo-Iweala, at the 2004 Spring Meetings of the
International Monetary Fund
and the
World Bank Group
Okonjo-Iweala had a 25-year career at the
World Bank
in
Washington, D.C.
, as a development economist and rose to the No. 2 position of Managing Director, Operations.
[
23
]
As Managing Director, she had oversight responsibility for the
World Bank
’s $81 billion operational portfolio in Africa,
South Asia
,
Europe
, and Central Asia. Okonjo-Iweala spearheaded several World Bank initiatives to assist low-income countries during the 2008–2009 food crises and later during the financial crisis. In 2010, she chaired the IDA replenishment, the World Bank’s successful drive to raise $49.3 billion in grants and low-interest credit for the world's poorest country.
[
24
]
During her time at the World Bank, she was also a member of the Commission on Effective Development Cooperation with Africa, which was set up by
Danish Prime Minister
Anders Fogh Rasmussen
and held meetings between April and October 2008.
[

In government
[
edit
]
Okonjo-Iweala served twice as Nigeria's
Finance Minister
(2003–2006 and 2011–2015) and briefly acted as
Foreign Minister
in 2006. She was the first woman to hold both positions. During her first tenure as Finance Minister in the administration of President
Olusegun Obasanjo
, she spearheaded negotiations with the
Paris Club
that led to the elimination of US$30 billion of Nigeria's debt, including the outright cancellation of US$18 billion.
[
26
]
In 2003, she led efforts to improve Nigeria’s
macroeconomic
management including the implementation of an oil-price based fiscal rule. Revenues accruing above a reference benchmark oil price were saved in a special account, the "Excess Crude Account," which helped to reduce macroeconomic volatility.
[
27
]
Okonjo-Iweala was also instrumental in helping Nigeria obtain its first ever
sovereign credit rating
(of BB minus) from
Fitch Ratings
and
Standard & Poor’s
in 2006.
[
22
]
She also introduced the practice of publishing the federal, state, and local government shares of revenue from the country’s federal account. That action went a long way in increasing transparency in governance at all levels of government, particularly the sub-national level.

[
