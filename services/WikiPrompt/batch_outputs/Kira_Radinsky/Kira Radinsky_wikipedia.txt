"I think the best way to predict the future is to create it. One of the things that we are doing right now is identifying the patterns, and when the patterns start, try to predict the next step. So, it can predict things that have a pattern. Random things? It’s a philosophical question. Do we even have random things? Or is it part of a pattern that we don’t have data for? So, if you believe there is no random thing and everything has a pattern, then AI can predict the future. We just need more data for that."
—Kira Radinsky, 2019.
