Gordon Brown's voice
Brown on education and infrastructure in the Middle East and North Africa
Recorded 30 March 2015
James Gordon Brown
(born 20 February 1951) is a British politician who served as
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
and
Leader of the Labour Party
from 2007 to 2010. Previously, he was
Chancellor of the Exchequer
from 1997 to 2007 under
Tony Blair
. Brown was
Member of Parliament
(MP) for
Dunfermline East
from 1983 to 2005 and for
Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath
from 2005 to 2015. He has served as
United Nations Special Envoy
for Global Education since 2012,
[
1
]
and he was appointed as
World Health Organization Ambassador
for Global Health Financing in 2021.
[
2
]
A
doctoral graduate
, Brown studied history at the
University of Edinburgh
. He spent his early career as a lecturer at a
further education
college and as a television journalist. Brown was elected to the
House of Commons
at the
1983 general election
as the MP for Dunfermline East. He was appointed to
Neil Kinnock
's
shadow cabinet
in 1989 and was named
Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer
by
John Smith
in 1992. Following Labour's victory in the
1997 general election
, Brown was appointed as chancellor, becoming the longest-serving in modern history.
Brown's time as chancellor
was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting to the
Bank of England
, extending the powers of the
Treasury
to cover much domestic policy, and transferring banking supervision to the
Financial Services Authority
. Brown presided over the longest period of economic growth in British history.
[
3
]
[
4
]
He outlined
five economic tests
, which resisted
the UK adopting the euro
. Controversial moves included the abolition of
advance corporation tax
(ACT) relief in his first budget,
[
5
]
[
6
]
the
sale of UK gold

reserves from 1999 to 2002
, and the removal in
his final budget
of the
10% starting rate
of income tax that he had introduced in
the 1999 budget
.
[
7
]
Following Blair's resignation in 2007, Brown was elected unopposed to succeed him as prime minister and party leader. The party continued as New Labour, though Brown's style of government differed from Blair's. He remained committed to
close ties with the United States
and to the
war in Iraq
, although he established an
inquiry into the reasons for Britain's participation
in the conflict.
Brown's government
introduced rescue packages to keep banks afloat during the
2008 financial crisis
, and so
national debt
increased. The government took majority shareholdings in
Northern Rock
and
Royal Bank of Scotland
, which had experienced severe financial difficulties, and injected public money into other banks. In 2008, Brown's government passed the world's first
Climate Change Act
, and he also introduced the
Equality Act 2010
. Despite poll rises just after Brown became prime minister, when he failed to call a
snap election
in 2007, his popularity fell and Labour's popularity declined with the
Great Recession
.
[
8
]
[
9
]
[
10
]
Labour lost 91 seats in the
2010 general election
, resulting in a
hung parliament
in which the
Conservative Party
won the most seats.
[
11
]
After the Conservatives formed
a coalition government
with the
Liberal Democrats
, Brown was succeeded as prime minister by Conservative leader
David Cameron
, and as Labour leader by
Ed Miliband
.
After leaving office, Brown returned to the
backbenches
, continuing to serve as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until he gave up his seat in 2015. He has since made occasional political interventions and has published political-themed books.
[
12
]
Brown played a prominent role in the campaign to maintain the union during the
2014 Scottish independence referendum
, and he wrote a report on
devolution
in 2022 for Labour leader
Keir Starmer
.
[
13
]
Brown has served as the United Nations
Special Envoy
for Global Education, as well as the
World Health Organization
's Ambassador for Global Health Financing.
[
14
]
He was awarded the
Order of the Companions of Honour
by
King Charles III
in the
2024 Birthday Honours
for public and charitable services in the UK and abroad. As chancellor,

Brown had high approval ratings; a poll of political scientists rated him the most successful post-war chancellor in terms of economic stability, working independently from the prime minister and leaving a lasting legacy on the
British economy
.
[
15
]
[
16
]
His premiership has been viewed less favourably; although public opinion of Brown has improved since he left office, his premiership has been viewed as average in
historical rankings
and public opinion of British prime ministers.

James Gordon Brown was born at the Orchard Maternity Nursing Home in
Giffnock
,
Renfrewshire
, Scotland.
[
17
]
[
18
]
His father was John Ebenezer Brown (1914–1998), a
minister of the Church of Scotland
and a strong influence on Brown.
[
19
]
His mother was Jessie Elizabeth "Bunty" Brown (
née
Souter; 1918–2004);
[
20
]
she was the daughter of John Souter, a timber merchant.
[
21
]
The family moved to
Kirkcaldy
– then the largest town in
Fife
, across the
Firth of Forth
from
Edinburgh
[
22
]
– when Gordon was three.
[
23
]
Brown was brought up there with his elder brother John and younger brother
Andrew
[
20
]
in a
manse
; he is therefore often referred to as a "son of the manse", an idiomatic Scottish phrase, similar to the American phrase "
preacher's kid
".
[
24
]
Education
Brown was educated first at Kirkcaldy West Primary School, where he was selected for an experimental
fast stream
education programme, which took him two years early to
Kirkcaldy High School
for an academic
hothouse education
taught in separate classes.
[
25
]
[

26
]
Aged 16, he wrote that he loathed and resented this "ludicrous" experiment on young lives.
[
27
]
He was accepted by the
University of Edinburgh
to study history at the same early age of 16. During an end-of-term
rugby union
match at his old school, he received a kick to the head and experienced a
retinal detachment
.
[
28
]
This left him
blind
in his left eye, despite treatment including several operations and weeks spent lying in a darkened room. Later at Edinburgh, while playing tennis, he noticed the same symptoms in his right eye. Brown underwent experimental surgery at the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
and his right eye was saved by a young eye surgeon, Hector Chawla.
[
29
]
[
30
]
Brown graduated from Edinburgh with an
undergraduate MA
degree with
First-Class Honours
in history in 1972. He stayed on to obtain his
PhD
degree in history, which he gained ten years later in 1982, defending a thesis titled
The Labour Party and Political Change in Scotland 1918–1929
.
[
31
]
[
32
]
[
33
]
In his youth at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was involved in a romantic relationship with
Margarita, Crown Princess of Romania
. Margarita said about it: "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right anymore, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing." An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by
Paul Routledge
in his biography of Brown as recalling: "She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other."
[
34
]
In 1972, while still a student, Brown was elected
Rector of the University of Edinburgh
, the convener of the
University Court
.
[
35
]
He served as Rector until 1975, and also edited the document
The Red Paper on Scotland
.
[
36
]
Career before Parliament
From 1976 to 1980 Brown was employed as a lecturer in politics at
Glasgow College of Technology
.
[
37
]
He also worked as a tutor for the
Open University
.
[
38
]
In the
1979 general election
, Brown stood for the
Edinburgh South
constituency, losing to the
Conservative
candidate,
Michael Ancram
.
[
32

]
From 1980, he worked as a journalist at
Scottish Television
, later serving as current affairs editor until his election to Parliament in 1983.
[
39
]
[
40
]
Election to Parliament and opposition
Tony Blair
(pictured) was a close colleague of Brown. Together, they made a pact (
Blair–Brown deal
) that Brown would succeed Blair as prime minister.
Brown was elected to Parliament as a Labour MP at his second attempt, for
Dunfermline East
in the
1983 general election
. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency,
Tony Blair
. Brown became an
opposition
spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the
Independent Labour Party
politician
James Maxton
, the subject of his doctoral thesis. Brown was
Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury
from 1987 to 1989 and then
Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
, before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992 following Labour's fourth consecutive defeat in the
general election
that year.
[
32
]
[
39
]
Having led the
Labour Movement Yes
campaign, refusing to join the cross-party
Yes for Scotland
campaign, during the
1979 Scottish devolution referendum
, while other senior Labour politicians – including
Robin Cook
,
Tam Dalyell
and
Brian Wilson
– campaigned for a
No
vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the
Scottish Constitutional Convention
, signing the
Claim of Right for Scotland
in 1989.
[
41
]
Labour leader
John Smith
died suddenly in May 1994. Brown did not contest the leadership after
Tony Blair
became the favourite to win the
1994 leadership election
, deciding to make way for Blair to avoid splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ballot.
[
42
]
It has long been rumoured
a deal
was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita restaurant in
Islington
, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election.
[
43
]
[
44
]
[
45
]
Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the fortunes of
New Labour
, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.
[
46
]
As
Shadow Chancellor
, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting was seen as a good choice by business and the

middle class
[
citation needed
]
. During his tenure as chancellor, the rate of inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target; the
Governor of the Bank of England
, under the rules governing the Bank's role, wrote an explanatory letter to the Chancellor on each occasion inflation exceeded three per cent.
[
47
]
[
48
]
Following a reorganisation of
Westminster constituencies
in Scotland in 2005, Brown became MP for
Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath
at the
general election
.
[
49

[

Chancellor of the Exchequer (1997–2007)
Main article:
Chancellorship of Gordon Brown
Brown's official portrait during
his chancellorship
In the
1997 general election
, Labour defeated the Conservatives by a landslide to end their 18-year exile from government, and when
Tony Blair
, the new prime minister, announced his
ministerial team
on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as
Chancellor of the Exchequer
. Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history.
[
30
]
Some achievements from Brown's decade as chancellor included making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the
G8
summit in 2005.
[
32
]
Early economic reforms
On taking office as chancellor, Brown gave the
Bank of England
operational independence in
monetary policy
, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's
Monetary Policy Committee
.
[
51
]
At the same time, he also changed the
inflation measure
from the
Retail Price Index
to the
Consumer Price Index
and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the
Financial Services Authority
.
[
52
]
[
53
]
Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the
2008 financial crisis
.
[
54
]
Taxation and spending
During the 1997 election campaign and subsequently, Brown pledged not to increase the basic or higher rates of
income tax
. Over his Chancellorship he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%; however, in all budgets but his final one, he increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation rather than with earnings, resulting in
fiscal drag
. Under Brown,
corporation tax
fell from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for
small businesses
.
[
55
]
In 1999, he introduced a lower
income tax band of 10%
.

He abolished this 10% tax band in
his last budget
in 2007 to reduce the basic rate from 22% to 20%, increasing tax for 5 million people
[
56
]
and, according to the calculations of the
Institute for Fiscal Studies
, leaving those earning between £5,000 and £18,000 as the biggest losers.
[
57
]
To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: "Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners at a cost of £3bn a year, I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non-savings income".
[
58
]
Brown also implemented the
Windfall Tax
in 1997 on the privatised utilities. The tax produced an estimated one-off income to the government of £5 billion, which was used to fund the New Deal for Young People, a welfare-to-work program that sought to tackle long-term unemployment.
[
59
]
According to the
OECD
, UK taxation increased from a 39.3% share of gross domestic product in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than that of Germany.
[
60
]
This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing "
stealth taxes
". A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way
corporation tax
is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the
dividends
on
stock
investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK.
[
61
]
Brown's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of
government spending
, particularly on health and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased
National Insurance
to pay for health spending. He also introduced
working tax credits
,
[
62
]
[
63
]
and in his last budget as chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3 billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1 billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.
[
64
]
Under Brown, the tax code, the standard guide to tax, doubled in length to 17,000 pages.
[
65
]
[
66
]
European single

currency
In October 1997, Brown announced that the Treasury would set
five economic tests
[
67
]
to determine whether the economic case had been made for the United Kingdom to adopt the European single currency. The Treasury indicated that the tests had not been passed in June 2003.
[
68
]
Other issues
In 2000, Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education (referred to as the
Laura Spence affair
) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures, describing its decision not to offer a place to state school pupil Laura Spence as "absolutely outrageous".
[
69
]
Lord Jenkins
, then Oxford
Chancellor
and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, said "nearly every fact he used was false."
[
70
]
Between 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's
gold reserves
shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as the
Brown Bottom
or Brown's Bottom.
[
71
]
[
72
]
[
73
]
The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the
portfolio risk
of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold.
[
74
]
The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 billion.
[
75
]
By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised.
[
76
]
As of August 2024 the gold prize is approximately £1,905 per ounce, which would value the reserves sold at £26.5 billion.
As Chancellor, Brown argued against
renationalising the railways
, saying at the Labour conference in 2004 that it would cost £22 billion.
[
77
]
During his time as chancellor, Brown reportedly believed that it was appropriate to remove most, but not all, of the unpayable
Third World debt
.
[
78
]
On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a "
Green
" view of global development.
[
79
]
Labour leadership bid
Main article:
2007 Labour Party leadership election (UK)
In October 2004, Blair announced he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term.
[
80
]
Political comment over the

relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the
2005 election
, which Labour won with a reduced
majority
and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year.
[
81
]
Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; he was the only
candidate
spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become prime minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and
global change
. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as prime minister; speaking at a
Fabian Society
conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities.
[
82
]
On 11 May 2007, after months of speculation, Brown formally announced his bid for the Labour leadership. He launched his campaign website the same day as formally announcing his bid for leadership, titled "Gordon Brown for Britain".
[
83
]
On 16 May,
Channel 4 News
announced that
Andrew MacKinlay
had nominated Brown, giving him 308 nominations—enough to avoid a leadership contest. A BBC report states that the decisive nomination was made by
Tony Wright
with MacKinlay yet to nominate at that point.
[
84
]
Brown replaced Blair as
Leader of the Labour Party
on 24 June 2007.
Prime minister (2007–2010)
Main article:
Premiership of Gordon Brown
Brown chairing his first cabinet meeting
After Blair tendered his resignation to
Queen Elizabeth II
, Brown was invited by the queen to form a government and become prime minister on 27 June 2007. In his first speech as prime minister, Brown said "This will be a new government with new priorities and I have been privileged to have been granted the great opportunity to serve my country. And at all times I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action, in the service of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country."
[
85
]
[
86
]
Brown rescinded some of the policies which had been introduced or were planned by Blair's administration. He remained

committed to
close ties with the United States
and to the war in Iraq, although he established
an inquiry into the reasons for Britain's participation in the conflict
. He proposed a "government of all the talents" which would involve co-opting leading personalities from industry and professional occupations into government positions. Brown also appointed
Jacqui Smith
as the UK's first female
Home Secretary
, while Brown's
former position
as
chancellor of the exchequer
was taken over by
Alistair Darling
. He proposed moving some traditional
prime ministerial powers
conferred by
royal prerogative
to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight of the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form "citizens' juries", easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the
loans for peerages
scandal.
[
87
]
Brown and
George W. Bush
, President of the United States, meet at Downing Street, June 2008
There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a
snap general election
. Indeed, the party launched the
Not flash, just Gordon
advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as prime minister; however, Brown announced on 6 October that there would be no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one.
[
88
]
This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by
David Cameron
) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in
Crewe
and
Glasgow
did himself and the government no favours either.
[
89
]
Brown has since claimed that Labour would have won the 2007 election but he did not believe an early election was in the national interest.
[
90
]
[
91
]
His political opponents accused him of being indecisive, which Brown denied.
[
92
]
In July 2008, he supported a
new bill extending the pre-charge detention period to 42 days
. The bill was met with opposition

on both sides of the House and backbench rebellion. In the end, the bill passed by just nine votes.
[
93
]
[
94
]
The House of Lords defeated the bill, with Lords characterising it as "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that "it seeks to further erode fundamental legal and civil rights".
[
95
]
Brown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner; however, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.

Domestic policy
Brown at the
World Economic Forum
meeting in Davos in 2008
During his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives, which he called the
manifesto for change
.
[
98
]
[
99
]
The manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new
Ministerial Code
, which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers.
[
100
]
He also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wanted a "better constitution" that is "clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today". He planned to set up an all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between
Whitehall
and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops were sent into action in future.
[
101
]
He said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal to build new
eco-towns
, each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 homeowners – up to 100,000 new homes in total.
[
102
]
Brown also said he wanted to have doctors' surgeries open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary
John Reid
, which awarded them a 22 per cent pay rise in 2006.
[
103
]
On 5 June 2007, just three weeks before he was due to take the post of prime minister, Brown made a speech promising "British Jobs for British

workers".
[
104
]
Brown reiterated that promise at the Labour Party's annual conference in September, which caused controversy as he coupled this with a commitment to crack down on migrant workers.
[
105
]
[
106
]
The Conservative Party, led by
David Cameron
, promptly pointed out that such a commitment was illegal under EU law.
[
106
]
Other controversial statements made by Brown about migration included him stating that English lessons and taking mandatory community service should be prerequisites for being granted UK citizenship.
[
107
]
During the Queen's Speech to Parliament on 3 December 2008, the Brown government unveiled plans to introduce lie detector tests, based on voice recognition technology, in order to determine whether to accept benefit claims.
[
108
]
Despite having spent £2.4 million on these tests, trials performed by the
Department for Work and Pensions
showed that they were inaccurate approximately four of every seven times they were used.

Foreign policy

, Brown, Canadian prime minister
Stephen Harper
and French president
Nicolas Sarkozy
arrive at the Colleville-sur-Mer cemetery to attend a ceremony marking the 65th anniversary of the
D-Day landings
in Normandy, 6 June 2009.
Brown had been committed to the
Iraq War
, but said in a speech in June 2007 that he would "learn the lessons" from the mistakes made in Iraq.
[
110
]
Brown said in a letter published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold
an inquiry into the war
.
[
111
]
Brown went to great lengths to empathise with those who lost family members in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. He has often said "War is tragic", echoing Blair's quote, "War is horrible".
[
112
]
Nonetheless, in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the
Military Covenant
, a convention within British politics ensuring adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government.
[
113
]
Brown did not attend the opening ceremony of the
2008 Summer Olympics
on 8 August 2008 in
Beijing
; instead, he attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to

send a message to
China
, concerning the
2008 Tibetan unrest
. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.
[
114
]
In a speech in July 2007, Brown clarified his position regarding Britain's relationship with the
United States
:
[
115
]
"We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America in dealing with the common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as
Tony Blair
did, very closely with the American administration."
Brown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the
Constitutional Treaty
.
[
116
]
On 13 December 2007,
Foreign Secretary
David Miliband
attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony for the
Treaty of Lisbon
. Brown's opponents on both sides of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original
EU Constitution
.
[
117
]
[
118
]
Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. Most notably the Supremacy Clause
[
119
]
was removed and replaced with a substantially weaker declaration.
[
120
]
He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.
[
121
]
Drug policy
During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs
(ACMD) recommended to the then
Home Secretary
Jacqui Smith
that
cannabis
remain classified as a
Class C drug
.
[
122
]
Acting against the advice of the council, she chose to reclassify it as
Class B
.
[
122
]
After Professor
David Nutt
, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary
Alan

Johnson
.
[
123
]
Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had "made up his mind" to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary.
[
124
]
Brown had argued, "I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable".
[
125
]
[
126
]
Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD,
Sir Michael Rawlins
, later said, "Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view ... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice".
[
127
]
Global recession
Brown's premiership coincided with the
global recession
, during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. Domestically, Brown's administration introduced measures including a
bank rescue package
worth around £500 billion (approximately $850 billion), a temporary 2.5 percentage point cut in
value-added tax
[
128
]
and a "car scrappage" scheme.
[
129
]
Challenges to leadership
In mid-2008, Brown's leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign.  This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from
(pre-1974) Lancashire
urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the
Labour Party
leadership.  Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest; however, certain prominent MPs, such as
Jacqui Smith
and
Bill Rammell
, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis.
[
130
]
In the autumn,
Siobhain McDonagh
, an MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government,
[
131
]
spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position.  While she did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour Party to hold a leadership election. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterward, on 12 September.
[
132
]
She was supported in making clear her desire for a contest by
Joan Ryan
(who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job),
Jim Dowd
,
Greg Pope
, and a string of others who

had previously held positions in government.
[
133
]
In the face of this speculation over Brown's future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and
Harriet Harman
and
David Miliband
denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the
Glasgow East by-election
in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the "solution", not the "problem"; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary
Jack Straw
, Schools Secretary
Ed Balls
and Cabinet Office Minister
Ed Miliband
all re-affirmed their support for Brown.
[
134
]
The
deputy prime minister
under Blair,
John Prescott
, also pledged his support.
[
135
]
Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in
The Guardian
was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the party's future, but neglected to mention the prime minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the
fatalism
in the party since the loss of
Glasgow East
.
[
136
]
Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September, as did
Business Secretary
John Hutton
,
Environment Secretary
Hilary Benn
, and
Chief Whip
Geoff Hoon
.
[
137
]
On 4 June 2009
James Purnell
resigned from the
Cabinet
, and called for Brown's resignation as prime minister.
[
138
]
On 6 January 2010,
Patricia Hewitt
and
Geoff Hoon
jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Brown's leadership.
[
139
]
The call received little support, and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was "over".  Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a "form of silliness".
[
140
]
By-elections and 2009 local and EU elections
Brown greeting then-U.S. vice president
Joe Biden
in
Chile
, April 2009
In the local elections on 1 May 2008, Labour suffered its worst results in 40 years, finishing in third place with a projected 24% share of the national vote.
[
141
]
Subsequently, the party saw the loss of by-elections in
Crewe and Nantwich
and
Henley
as well as slumps in the

polls. A
by-election in Glasgow East
triggered by the resignation of
David Marshall
saw Labour struggle to appoint a candidate, eventually settling for
Margaret Curran
, a sitting MSP in the
Scottish Parliament
. The SNP, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all derided Labour for their disorganised nature, with
Alex Salmond
commenting "This is their 'lost weekend'—they don't have a leader in Scotland, they don't have a candidate in Glasgow East, and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency".
[
142
]
Labour lost the constituency to the
Scottish National Party
's
John Mason
who took 11,277 votes, with Labour just 365 behind. The seat experienced a swing of 22.54%.
[
143
]
In the
European elections
, Labour polled 16% of the vote, finishing in third place behind the Conservatives and
UK Independence Party
(UKIP).
[
10
]
Voter apathy was reflected in the historically low turnout of around thirty-three per cent. In Scotland, voter turnout was only twenty-eight per cent. In the
local elections
, Labour polled 23% of the vote, finishing in third place behind
Conservatives
and
Liberal Democrats
, with Labour losing control of the four councils it had held prior to the election.
[
144
]
In a vote widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal, the share of the votes was down for all the major parties; Labour was down one per cent, the Conservative share was down five per cent. The beneficiary of the public backlash was generally seen to be the minor parties, including the
Green Party
and UKIP. These results were Labour's worst since World War II. Brown was quoted in the press as having said that the results were "a painful defeat for Labour", and that "too many good people doing so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own."

[

He played a prominent role in the lead-up to, and the aftermath of, the
2014 Scottish independence referendum
, campaigning for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom.
[
153
]
"Our vision for the future of Scotland – yes a Scottish parliament for fairness, battling for equality across the UK", he told voters in an impassioned speech on the eve of polling. "But our vision is bigger than that – at every point, particularly through our membership of the UK, to fight for what is our dream, what is our demand. A world not of a separate state, but a world of social justice people can believe in. What kind of message does Scotland send to the world if, tomorrow, we said

we are going to give up on sharing, we are going to smash our partnership, we are going to abandon co-operation and we are going to throw the idea of solidarity into the dust. This is not the Scotland I know and recognise."
[

In April 2011, media reports linked Brown with the role of managing director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of

Ed Miliband

Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced.

On 5 December 2022, having led development of a Labour party blueprint on
constitutional reform
, Brown announced the publication of these proposals alongside future Labour prime minister
Keir Starmer
.
[

These proposals included plans for the replacement of the
House of Lords
with a "Assembly of the Nations and Regions", electing around 200 members on a different electoral cycle to that of the
House of Commons
.
[
172
]
Other measures include the "strengthening of the
Sewel Convention
" such that the ability of devolved administrations to veto UK Parliament legislation affecting devolved issues is "constitutionally protected", plans to grant the Scottish Parliament greater powers over foreign affairs "so that Scotland could sign up to international groups or agreements within devolved areas" such as
Erasmus
, and plans to transfer powers to English regions and local mayors.
[

The proposals were criticised by the
SNP
who described them as "underwhelming",
[

and the
Speaker of the House of Commons
