Deforestation

Main article:
Deforestation in Brazil
Teixeira is devoted to reversing the
deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest
, and achieved an 84% reduction in
deforestation
from 2004 to 2012, a "remarkable feat that is a tribute to her courage to push against the tide of destruction and is a significant initiative from Brazil on
climate change mitigation
". Her land-use planning policies saved 250,000 km
2
of conservation areas—the equivalent of 75 percent of protected forests in the world.
[
7
]
From August 2012 to July 2013, the rate of deforestation increased by 29% in the
Amazônia Legal
(Legal Amazon),
[
9
]
and from 2013 to 2014, it rose by 358%.
[
10
]
With Teixeira as Environment Minister, Brazil has also refused to sign the anti-deforestation pledge that aims to reduce deforestation by 2030, dealing a blow to the Climate Change summit that took place in New York in October 2014. “Unfortunately, we were not consulted,” Brazil’s Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira told the Associated Press.

2014 FIFA World Cup
[
edit
]
On 24 May 2014, Teixeira announced a pollution-reducing initiative aimed at making the
2014 FIFA World Cup
the most environmentally friendly ever by allowing companies to buy
carbon credits
in
exchange
for the right to advertise themselves as official “green seal” World Cup sponsors. In addition, along with the
United Nations Environment Program
, Teixeira launched a project called “green passport” that promoted
sustainable tourism
.
