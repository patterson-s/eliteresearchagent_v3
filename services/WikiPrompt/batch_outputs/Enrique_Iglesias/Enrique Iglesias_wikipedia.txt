his family's nanny and recorded a demo cassette tape which consisted of a Spanish song and two English songs.

Experiencia Religiosa
" (Religious Experience). The record was released by label
Fonovisa
, along with Iglesias's following two albums.
[

The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English. The record also ended up being certified Gold in another non-Spanish-speaking territory (

editions, with most of the songs being sung in those languages.

music market. Thanks to other successful Latin crossover acts, most notably
Ricky Martin
,
Jennifer Lopez
, and soon thereafter
Shakira
, Spanish-language and Latino musicians experienced a great surge in popularity amongst the public. After attending one of Iglesias's concerts in March 1999, American actor
Will Smith
asked Iglesias to contribute a song to the soundtrack of his upcoming movie
Wild Wild West
; Iglesias's contribution of "Bailamos" was released as a single that year, becoming an international hit and peaking at number one on the US
Billboard Hot 100
.
[

After the success of "
Bailamos
", several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal, after weeks of negotiations with
Interscope
, Iglesias recorded and released his first full record in English,
Enrique
. The pop album featured some clear Latin musical influences, and took two months to complete. It contained the popular song "
Rhythm Divine
", a duet with
Whitney Houston
titled "
Could I Have This Kiss Forever
", and a cover of the
Bruce Springsteen
song "
Sad Eyes
".

Shock jock
Howard Stern
repeatedly played a tape of a (supposedly) very off-key Iglesias on his radio show, accusing him of "not being able" to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias came to New York and sang the song, live and unplugged, on Stern's show with just an accompanying guitarist. After the performance, the two had an interview, and Stern remarked, "I respect you for coming in here; you really can sing."
[

Iglesias noted that the recording could have been him, but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to
lip sync
and not sing properly.
[

He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single "
Be with You
" became Iglesias's second number-one single on
