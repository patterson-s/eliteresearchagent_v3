For educational programs at military academies like West Point (typically 4-year programs), he likely started around 1943, but since we only have definitive evidence for the graduation date of June 1947, and following the guideline that 'if only a single year is mentioned, set both time_start and time_finish to that year,' I'm setting both to 1947 to represent the completion/graduation year."
