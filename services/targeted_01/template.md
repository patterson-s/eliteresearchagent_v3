Elite ID
20 February 2026

The goal is to come up with a set of instructions and questions that the LLM may then use to identify and organize key data points about our HLP-derived sample of global elites. The original goal – drawing the full career trajectory for each individual – has proven out of hand. This is a more targeted attempt at categorizing them along a limited set of dimensions allowing for comparison and pattern finding.

# 1)	HLP nomination

Which HLP was this individual nominated for? At what age (based on date of birth)? What was his or her job title at that moment? What nationality is reported?

# 2)	Education trajectory

This concerns university degrees (e.g., BA, MA, PhD). We’re interested to know (1) whether education was acquired in the Global South, Global North, or both; (2) in what disciplines degrees were earned (e.g., law, economics, science); and (3) whether degrees come from elite institutions (e.g., Oxbridge, Ivy League), from peripheral ones or both.

# 3)	Main locations [geographical mobility]

Identify the different cities and/or countries in which the individual may be presumed to have lived for six months or more, based on the jobs held and other life experiences. 

# 4)	Main jobs (roles and employers) [organizational mobility]

Identify the main “job titles” or “job descriptions” that this person has held, based on duration, with the afferent organization/employer. Examples include advisor, secretary-general, CEO, director, section head, administrator, board member, permanent representative, ambassador, minister, consultant, professor, judge, lawyer, economist, journalist, banker, fellow, etc.

# 5)	Main sectors of expertise [functional mobility]

Identify the key issue-areas (problems, themes, fields of intervention) in which the individual has worked. Some may have only one sector of expertise while others have several. Examples include development, human rights, peace and mediation, finance, trade, elections, technology, science, government, diplomacy, international law, environment, global health, migrations, etc.

# 6)	Main professional networks [revolving doors / roundabouts]

Identify associations, boards, clubs, institutional ties, memberships or other elite affiliations held by the individual over the course of the career. These may include significant awards or distinctions. 

# 7)	Career domain [archetypes]

This measure seeks to identify a dominant domain in the individual’s career. “Dominant” means in the overall trajectory, a certain type of jobs was held for longer and/or more frequently than others. Career domains include: academic (research, science, teaching); civil society (NGOs, foundations, advocacy); corporate (business, commerce, finance); diplomatic (international organizations, foreign ministry); political (senior leadership); or other. (If other, please suggest an alternate career domain). If a given individual is thoroughly “hybrid” (not one dominant domain but several), report as such.
