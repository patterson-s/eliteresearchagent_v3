Primary roles are heavily weighted towards political and international domains. Step 2 — Duration weighting: Political roles span approximately 15 years (1974-1996), international role spans 5 years (1998-2003), and diplomatic role spans 3 years (2007-2010). Political domain has the longest duration. Step 3 — Sectors cross-check: Primary sector is global_health, which aligns with international and diplomatic roles, but her extensive political roles in government reinforce the political domain. Step 4 — Networks cross-check: Affiliations with UN, WHO, and advisory roles in international bodies reinforce international and diplomatic signals, but her long-standing political roles and networks (e.g., Prime Minister, Labour Party Leader) strongly support the political domain. Step 5 — Dominant domain identification: Political domain is the most dominant due to the number, duration, and prominence of roles.
