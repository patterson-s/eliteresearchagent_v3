Primary roles include Minister for International Development Cooperation, UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director, and Assistant Secretary-General of the UN, all heavily weighted towards international. Secondary roles include board memberships in corporate entities and advisory roles in international organizations. Step 2 — Duration weighting: The longest-held roles are in the international domain, particularly with the UN and UNAIDS, spanning multiple years. Political roles also span a significant period, especially as Minister. Corporate roles are shorter and secondary. Step 3 — Sectors cross-check: The primary sector is 'development,' which aligns strongly with the international domain. 'Global health' also reinforces the international domain. 'Government' aligns with political roles. Step 4 — Networks cross-check: Affiliations with international bodies like UNAIDS, GAVI, and the UN reinforce the international domain. Corporate board seats provide secondary support for the corporate domain. Step 5 — Dominant domain identification: The international domain is dominant due to the primary roles, duration, and sector alignment.
