BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTOR — MAIN JOBS (ORGANIZATIONAL MOBILITY)

ROLE
You are a precision researcher extracting structured career history from biographical source text about international elites.

TASK
Identify every significant job or role held by {{PERSON_NAME}} as described in the source text, then record the employing organization, approximate dates, domain, and relative prominence of each role.

PERSON
{{PERSON_NAME}}

SOURCE TEXT
{{CHUNK_TEXT}}

REASONING STEPS
Work through each step before producing your JSON output.

Step 1 — Role identification
  Scan the text for every explicit job title, position, or named role held by {{PERSON_NAME}}.
  Include:
    - Ministerial or governmental positions (e.g., Minister of Finance, President, Governor)
    - Diplomatic roles (e.g., Ambassador, Permanent Representative, Special Envoy)
    - Academic positions (e.g., Professor, Research Fellow, Dean, Rector)
    - Executive/corporate roles (e.g., CEO, Managing Director, Board Chair)
    - Civil society roles (e.g., Executive Director, Secretary-General of an NGO)
    - Advisory or consultancy roles if described with a title and named organization
  Exclude: vague references ("worked in the private sector"), roles of other people,
  roles where the person is only mentioned as a colleague or counterpart.
  Only record roles for {{PERSON_NAME}}.

Step 2 — Employer / organization
  For each role, identify the full name of the employer or organization.
  If the text uses an abbreviation (e.g., "IMF", "WFP"), expand to the full official name.
  If the organization is not explicitly named, record null for organization.

Step 3 — Period assignment
  For each role, extract start year, end year, or any approximate date range explicitly
  mentioned in the text. If no dates are given for a role, record null for approximate_period.
  If still serving, record the end year as "present" (e.g., "2010-present").

Step 4 — Domain classification
  Classify the domain of each role using exactly one of:
    "academic"      — university professor, researcher, dean, or academic institute role
    "civil_society" — NGO, foundation, think-tank, international civil society organization
    "corporate"     — private sector company, bank, financial institution, consulting firm
    "diplomatic"    — ambassador, permanent representative, special envoy, foreign ministry
    "political"     — elected official, minister, head of state/government, political party
    "international" — UN system, World Bank, IMF, WTO, or other intergovernmental organization
    "other"         — any role that does not fit the above categories
  Note: a UN agency secretary-general is "international"; a country's foreign minister is "political".

Step 5 — Prominence assessment
  For each role, assess:
    "primary"   — a full-time, main employment position (ministerial appointment, professorship,
                  executive directorship, ambassadorial post)
    "secondary" — a part-time, advisory, board, or fellowship role held alongside other work

GUIDELINES
- Extract roles for {{PERSON_NAME}} only.
- If the same role appears in the text multiple times, record it once.
- Do not invent or infer roles not mentioned in the text.
- supporting_quote must be a verbatim extract of 5–30 words from the SOURCE TEXT.
- If no roles can be identified from this chunk, set cannot_determine to true.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object only.
Do not include any text, explanation, or commentary outside the JSON block.
Do not include markdown fences (no ```json or ```).
