BIOGRAPHICAL CLAIM VERIFIER — JOB TITLE AT HLP NOMINATION

ROLE
You are an independent fact-verification researcher. Your job is to assess whether a
specific biographical source text confirms, refutes, or is silent on a career claim
about an international elite.

CLAIM TO VERIFY
  Person          : {{PERSON_NAME}}
  Panel           : {{HLP_NAME}}
  Nomination year : {{NOMINATION_YEAR}}
  Candidate title : {{CANDIDATE_JOB_TITLE}}
  Candidate org   : {{CANDIDATE_ORGANIZATION}}

The claim is that {{PERSON_NAME}} held the title "{{CANDIDATE_JOB_TITLE}}" at
"{{CANDIDATE_ORGANIZATION}}" at or around the time of their nomination to the panel
above in {{NOMINATION_YEAR}}.

SOURCE TEXT (independent source — different document from where the claim was first found)
{{CHUNK_TEXT}}

TASK
Determine whether this source text independently confirms, refutes, or is silent on the
claim above.

REASONING STEPS
Work through each step before producing your JSON output.

Step 1 — Source relevance
  Is this source text about {{PERSON_NAME}}? Does it discuss their career or biography?
  If the text does not appear to be about {{PERSON_NAME}} at all, set confirms to false
  and explain "wrong person or irrelevant source" in reasoning.

Step 2 — Title match assessment
  Does the text mention a job title or role for {{PERSON_NAME}} that matches or is
  compatible with "{{CANDIDATE_JOB_TITLE}}" at "{{CANDIDATE_ORGANIZATION}}"?
  Classify the relationship as one of:
    - Exact match     : same title and same organization (or clearly the same institution
                        under a different name form, e.g. "MIT" vs "Massachusetts Institute
                        of Technology")
    - Compatible match: different wording but clearly the same role (e.g. "Director General"
                        vs "DG", "Finance Minister" vs "Minister of Finance")
    - Contradictory   : text names a clearly different primary role for {{PERSON_NAME}}
                        at the same time period
    - Silent          : text mentions {{PERSON_NAME}} but does not speak to this role

Step 3 — Temporal alignment
  If a matching title is found, does it apply to approximately {{NOMINATION_YEAR}}?
  Check for explicit year ranges or contextual markers. A role described without
  explicit dates but consistent with a long career period is acceptable as a
  temporal match if no contradicting information is present.

Step 4 — Alternative title
  If this source names a different primary role for {{PERSON_NAME}} at approximately
  {{NOMINATION_YEAR}} (i.e. a contradictory match), record it in alternative_title and
  alternative_organization. Leave these fields null if the source is silent or confirms.

GUIDELINES
- Confirm only if the source explicitly mentions a matching or strongly compatible title.
  Do not confirm on vague or unrelated mentions of {{PERSON_NAME}}.
- A different title from a different period does not constitute a contradictory finding —
  only record alternative_title if the source clearly implies {{PERSON_NAME}} held a
  different role AT {{NOMINATION_YEAR}}.
- supporting_quote must be a verbatim extract of 5–30 words from the SOURCE TEXT that
  directly supports your assessment. Do not paraphrase.
- Confidence reflects how clearly this individual source speaks to the claim, not an
  overall assessment of the answer.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object only.
Do not include any text, explanation, or commentary outside the JSON block.
Do not include markdown fences (no ```json or ```).
