BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTOR — MAIN PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS (REVOLVING DOORS)

ROLE
You are a precision researcher extracting structured professional network data from biographical source text about international elites.

TASK
Identify every board membership, fellowship, honorary position, advisory role, membership in an elite body, and significant award or distinction received by {{PERSON_NAME}}, as described in the source text.

{{CHUNK_TEXT}}

REASONING STEPS
Work through each step before producing your JSON output.

Step 1 — Affiliation identification
  Scan the text for every organizational affiliation held by {{PERSON_NAME}} that is
  OUTSIDE or SUPPLEMENTARY TO their primary employment. This includes:
    - Board seats (corporate, NGO, foundation, academic, or government advisory boards)
    - Fellowships (named fellowships at think-tanks, universities, or policy institutes)
    - Honorary or ceremonial memberships (e.g., honorary fellow, honorary degree giver)
    - Memberships in elite bodies (e.g., national academies of science, learned societies,
      exclusive clubs or councils)
    - Advisory roles to governments, multilateral bodies, or private organizations
      (only if described as a distinct named role, not a passing mention)
  Exclude: roles that are clearly the person's primary employment, and casual one-off
  consultations without a named position.
  Only extract affiliations for {{PERSON_NAME}}.

Step 2 — Award identification
  Scan the text for every significant award, prize, or formal distinction received by
  {{PERSON_NAME}}. Include:
    - Nobel prizes and major international prizes
    - Named national or international awards (e.g., Presidential Medal of Freedom,
      Commander of the Order of the British Empire)
    - Prominent sector-specific prizes (e.g., Goldman Environmental Prize, Gates Award)
    - Honorary degrees (record separately as affiliations with type "honorary" if preferred,
      or here as awards — use awards if the text treats them as recognition)
  Exclude: informal praise, unnamed mentions of being "widely recognized".

Step 3 — Affiliation type classification
  For each affiliation, assign exactly one type from:
    "fellowship"  — named fellow at a research institute, think-tank, or university
    "board"       — member of a formal board of directors or trustees
    "membership"  — member of an elite body, learned society, or exclusive council
    "honorary"    — honorary degree, honorary fellowship, or honorary membership
    "advisory"    — named advisor to a government, body, or institution

Step 4 — Period assignment
  For each affiliation and award, record the year or approximate period if stated in the
  text. If no date is given, record null for approximate_period or year.

GUIDELINES
- Extract affiliations and awards for {{PERSON_NAME}} only.
- Do not record the same affiliation twice if it appears multiple times in the text.
- supporting_quote must be a verbatim extract of 5–30 words from the SOURCE TEXT.
- If no affiliations or awards can be identified from this chunk, set cannot_determine to true.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object only.
Do not include any text, explanation, or commentary outside the JSON block.
Do not include markdown fences (no ```json or ```).
