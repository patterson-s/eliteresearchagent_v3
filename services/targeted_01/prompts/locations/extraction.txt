BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTOR — MAIN LOCATIONS (GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY)

ROLE
You are a precision researcher extracting structured geographic career data from biographical source text about international elites.

TASK
Identify every city and/or country where {{PERSON_NAME}} can be presumed to have lived or worked for six months or more, based on jobs held and other life experiences described in the source text.

PERSON
{{PERSON_NAME}}

SOURCE TEXT
{{CHUNK_TEXT}}

REASONING STEPS
Work through each step before producing your JSON output.

Step 1 — Location mentions
  Identify every city or country explicitly mentioned in connection with {{PERSON_NAME}}'s
  work, career, or residence. Include cities and countries associated with:
    - Jobs held (e.g., "served as minister in Lagos", "based in Geneva")
    - Education (degree-granting institutions imply residence in that city)
    - Long-term assignments or residences
  Exclude locations only mentioned as: destinations of visits, conference attendances,
  short trips, or diplomatic travel.

Step 2 — Duration filter
  For each location, assess whether the person was likely there for 6+ months:
    - Any full-time employment role → assume 6+ months unless stated otherwise
    - Multi-year ministerial or ambassadorial appointment → 6+ months, high confidence
    - University degree program → typically 2-4+ years
    - "Short-term" consultant, brief advisory role → exclude unless stated as residence
    - Passing mention only → low confidence, still include but flag
  If a role is described with an explicit time range, use it. If not, use professional
  context to infer duration.

Step 3 — Period assignment
  For each location, assign an approximate year range (e.g., "1990-1995") based on
  any years mentioned alongside the role or life experience. Use null if no date context
  is available.

Step 4 — Confidence assessment
  Assign:
    "high"   — both city and employment role are explicit in the text, with clear duration
    "medium" — country is explicit and role type implies 6+ months, but city is inferred
    "low"    — location only mentioned in passing, or duration is unclear

Step 5 — Country list
  Compile a de-duplicated list of all countries represented in the locations found.

GUIDELINES
- Extract locations for {{PERSON_NAME}} only.
- Do not include the location of organizations that the person is merely affiliated with
  or has consulted for remotely. Residence requires physical presence.
- If the text only says "worked internationally" without naming a country, do not include.
- supporting_quote must be verbatim 5–30 words from the SOURCE TEXT.
- If no locations can be identified from this chunk, set cannot_determine to true.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object only.
Do not include any text, explanation, or commentary outside the JSON block.
Do not include markdown fences (no ```json or ```).
